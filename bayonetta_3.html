                <h1>Bayonetta 3</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">An alternate universe Bayonetta fights against Singularity, but is killed as Viola watches and inherits the last of her power. Viola is tasked by her commanding officer Sigurd to use a world bridge to escape to another universe, and to seek help in the battle against Singularity. Viola uses the world bridge and escapes as Sigurd is killed, arriving in a universe where Bayonetta and Jeanne witness the Homunculi launching their attack on New York City. Taking refuge with Enzo in Rodin's bar the Gates of Hell, Viola explains that the Homunculi and Singularity have already destroyed countless alternate universes; Rodin confirms that if all universes collapse, Singularity will have ultimate power over the Trinity of Realities. To stop Singularity, Bayonetta and Viola must travel to the island of Thule, which serves as a gateway between universes, and collect the Chaos Gears that can lead them to the "Alphaverse" where Singularity resides. Jeanne is tasked with infiltrating a research facility to locate their universe's version of Sigurd, a doctor and scientist with knowledge about the multiverse.<br><br>Bayonetta and Viola arrive at Thule and fight across several alternate universes. During the travels, Bayonetta pursues alternate universe incarnations of herself who are protecting their own worlds, and fights alongside them to obtain the Chaos Gears; each is ultimately killed and absorbed by a vessel of Singularity, who is pursuing each Bayonetta incarnation as the "Arch-Eve", which can influence reality. Viola ends up pursuing Luka, who has been following them throughout the multiverse. Viola discovers that the deaths of his counterparts across the multiverse has caused Luka to transform into a wolf-like beast known as Strider, influenced by the rage of the Alphaverse's incarnation dubbed Dark Adam. During the game Viola reveals she is the daughter of her universe's Bayonetta and Luka, and encounters an alternate Luka dubbed "Lukaon", king of the faeries with knowledge of the multiverse. Jeanne manages to retrieve Sigurd and reconvenes with Bayonetta and Viola on Thule. Using the Chaos Gears, Sigurd opens up a portal into the Alphaverse, allowing Bayonetta and Viola access. Upon their arrival, they discover that Singularity's real identity was the Alphaverse's Sigurd, an artificial human who sought absolute power over the multiverse.<br><br>Singularity, who was impersonating Sigurd, kills Jeanne and traps Bayonetta and Viola in the Alphaverse. Luka reaches the Alphaverse too, with Bayonetta defeating Dark Adam and Lukaon restoring Luka's mind and allowing him to become "Arch-Adam", a guide to the Arch-Eve. Bayonetta, identified by Singularity as "Arch-Eve Origin", pursues and fights Singularity, freeing the spirits of Jeanne and the other Bayonettas, who briefly aid her before vanishing. She is then aided by incarnations of herself from Bayonetta and Bayonetta 2, and finally kills Singularity with help from Viola, Luka and a final Demon Summoning; Singularity's death restores the multiverse. Bayonetta, wounded and exhausted, loses control of Gomorrah and her soul is knocked from her body. Luka subdues the summon and embraces Bayonetta, restoring her body; they are dragged into Inferno, leaving Viola behind. Post-credits sequences show Viola defeating Dark Eve, a remnant of the Alphaverse's Bayonetta, and being given the "Bayonetta" title as a final message from Bayonetta; and later going to school in New York while taking on jobs for Rodin.<br><br>The universe of Bayonetta is set in a location known as Trinity of Realities, which comprises Paradiso, the realm of angels; Inferno, the realm of demons; and the World of Chaos, the human world. The World of Chaos is composed of multiple alternate universes, which makes for the main setting of Bayonetta 3. The titular witch Bayonetta — known also by her real name Cereza — returns as its protagonist, an Umbran Witch who makes contracts with demons to fight angels. She is joined by a witch-in-training Viola, who fights alongside her demon familiar Cheshire. They team up in order to fight against the forces of man-made artificial weapons called "Homunculi"; led by an artificial entity known as "Singularity", which seeks to eliminate all worlds in the multiverse to strengthen itself and conquer the Trinity of Realities. The two are assisted by Bayonetta's childhood friend and fellow Umbran witch Jeanne, the investigative reporter Luka, the information broker Enzo, and the demonic arms dealer Rodin.</div>
