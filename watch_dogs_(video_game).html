                <h1>Watch Dogs (Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In 2012, Chicago becomes the first city in the world to implement ctOS (Central Operating System) – a computing network connecting every device together into a single system, developed by technology company Blume. While conducting an electronic heist at the Merlaut Hotel, hacker Aiden Pearce and his mentor and partner, Damien Brenks, trigger a silent alarm set by another hacker. Damien tries to find the hacker, giving himself and Aiden away. Fearing for his family, Aiden drives them to safety in the guise of a surprise trip to the country. On the way, hitman Maurice Vega attacks them, resulting in a car crash that kills Aiden's six-year-old niece Lena.<br><br>A year later, Aiden tracks down Vega at a baseball stadium, but is unsuccessful in learning the identity of his contractor. Leaving Vega in the hands of his partner, hired fixer Jordi Chin, Aiden visits his sister Nicole and nephew Jackson for the latter's birthday but learns someone is harassing them. With the help of Clara Lille, a member of the hacking syndicate DedSec that is trying to expose Blume's corruption, Aiden tracks down the harasser, revealed to be Damien, who wanted to get Aiden's attention so that he will help him find the other hacker from the Merlaut job. Aiden refuses but, after dealing with a witness from the stadium, he learns that Damien kidnapped Nicole to force him to comply.<br><br>Setting up a new hideout in the Bunker – an undetectable former Blume base with access to ctOS – Aiden tracks down the hacker with Clara's help: gang leader and Army veteran Delford 'Iraq' Wade. To reach Iraq's servers, Aiden infiltrates a human auction he is attending to copy his access key, and blackmails his cousin Tyrone "Bedbug" Hayes into acting as his inside man. Bedbug manages to obtain a data sample revealing that Iraq has information on almost every citizen of Chicago, protecting his gang from the authorities via blackmail.<br><br>As the data recovered by Bedbug is encrypted beyond Aiden and Clara's abilities, they decide to track down legendary hacker and former Blume whistleblower Raymond "T-Bone" Kenney, who caused the Northeast blackout of 2003 while trying to expose the dangers of ctOS, which he had helped to create. Aiden finds Kenney but the latter refuses to leave until Aiden erases his identity from ctOS to allow him to return to Chicago. Aiden does so after infiltrating the Blume headquarters, but in the process he discovers that Damien gave up Kenney's location in exchange for full access to ctOS. This forces Aiden to protect Kenney from Blume's private security forces, before the two return to Chicago. There, Aiden assaults Iraq's compound to finish downloading its server data, and kills Iraq when the latter confronts him.<br><br>Aiden, Kenney, and Clara are unable to decrypt Iraq's data because another hacker, JB "Defalt" Markowicz, infiltrates their system, steals it, and deletes it from their servers. Defalt also reveals that Clara was hired to track down Aiden after the Merlaut job, therefore being indirectly responsible for Lena's death, which causes Aiden to angrily dismiss her. Meanwhile, Damien demands to know Aiden's progress, so the latter sets up a meeting where he lies that he has the data Damien wants, and demands Nicole's release. However, Damien calls Aiden's bluff and, in retaliation, exposes his identity to the authorities. After dealing with Defalt and retrieving the stolen data, Aiden tracks down Nicole with Kenney's help and rescues her, allowing her and Jackson to leave Chicago for their safety.<br><br>As Kenney finishes decrypting the data, he informs Aiden of who ordered the hit on him: Irish Mob boss and Merlaut owner Dermot "Lucky" Quinn. Aiden confronts Quinn, who reveals he ordered the hit because he believed Aiden was searching for secret video footage of Mayor Donovan Rushmore killing Rose Washington, a former Blume engineer who was used by the company and Quinn in a plot to blackmail the mayor. After killing Quinn by hacking his pacemaker, Aiden is informed by Damien that Quinn sent hitmen after Clara for being a liability. Unable to save Clara, Aiden makes the video of Washington's murder public, enraging Damien, who hoped to use the blackmail material for his own gain. As Damien wreaks havoc in Chicago using ctOS. Aiden shuts down the system using a virus created by Kenney and causes a massive blackout that shuts down Chicago and other cities via satellite, before tracking Damien to a lighthouse. Jordi arrives, having been hired to kill both men, but Aiden injures him and kills Damien. Later, Jordi calls Aiden one last time to tell him where Vega is kept; Aiden heads there and decides his fate.</div>
