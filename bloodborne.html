                <div class="synopsis-content">The player character, a Hunter, is being operated on by an old man, who explains that he is performing a blood transfusion to allow them to sign a "contract", mentioning a mysterious condition referred to as Paleblood. After the character creation (referred to as a "contract"), he warns the Hunter that they will go on a strange journey that may seem like a bad dream. The Hunter blacks out and awakens. A large, flesh-torn beast rises from the floor and menaces them. A sudden fire forces the beast's retreat, and then small, emaciated creatures ("Messengers") crawl over the Hunter as they black out again. The Hunter then awakens on an operating table in a different clinic in a place called Yharnam.<br><br>The Hunter finds their first lantern, which when lit and interacted with, transports them to a spectral realm called the Hunter's Dream where they encounter Gehrman, an elderly wheelchair-using man who provides advice, and The Doll, a living doll who assists the player in levelling up. Gehrman explains that to obtain the blood they seek and escape the dream, they must hunt down the beasts raging through Yharnam and halt the source of the plague.<br><br>While traveling Central Yharnam, the Hunter is told to seek out the Healing Church because of its connection to blood ministration, which is linked to the plague. After fighting through many beasts, the Hunter makes it to the church, where they come into contact with a beast skull that bids them to visit Byrgenwerth. Arriving at the school, the Hunter discovers a cosmic being named Rom underneath the local lake and slays it.<br><br>With Rom's death, the Hunter gains access to a higher degree of perception and sees Queen Yharnam, an ancient being from the dead civilization who supposedly bore Mergo, the source of the Nightmare. With their new perception, the Hunter can venture to the previously hidden village of Yahar'gul, where the now-visible Great Ones reside to be researched and worshipped by the School of Mensis. The scholars sought to build a vessel for a Great One, known as The One Reborn. After slaughtering it, the player accesses the spectral realm called the Nightmare of Mensis, where they discover the insane head of the school, Micolash. After killing him, the player encounters Mergo and their guardian.<br><br>After slaying Mergo's Wet Nurse and letting Mergo die, the Hunter returns to the Hunter's Dream where Gehrman offers to help them escape the dream. At this point, three different endings are possible, depending on the player's actions:
