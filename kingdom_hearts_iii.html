                <h1>Kingdom Hearts Iii</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Yen Sid begins preparing seven Keyblade wielders as guardians of light to counteract Master Xehanort's plan of forging the χ-blade. Sora, accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, resumes his travels across other worlds to regain his "power of waking", the ability to restore lost hearts, which he lost after nearly being possessed by Xehanort.[d] Sora's group is antagonized by members of Organization XIII, who target the seven Princesses of Heart as substitutes for the guardians while seeking a new member for their thirteenth and final spot. Meanwhile, Riku and King Mickey search the realm of darkness to retrieve Aqua, while Kairi and Lea train as Keyblade wielders.<br><br>Sora and Riku are contacted throughout their travels by former Organization member Ienzo, who uncovers research notes from Ansem the Wise revealing that the hearts of Roxas and two others—later identified as Ventus and Xion—are dormant within Sora's heart. Sora suggests implanting Roxas's heart in an artificial Replica body made by Vexen, one of the Organization's reserves, after learning that the Organization's time-traveling members are using the same method to exist in the present. Meanwhile, the Heartless Ansem abducts Ansem the Wise from the realm of darkness, but Vexen rescues Ansem the Wise. Revealing himself as a double agent, Vexen enlists fellow reserve Demyx to deliver a spare Replica for Roxas to inhabit.<br><br>Riku and Mickey are attacked by Aqua, who has become corrupted by the dark realm's influence. Discovering Master Eraqus's Keyblade on the Destiny Islands, Sora uses it to enter the realm of darkness and aid his friends, defeating and restoring Aqua. Aqua then travels to awaken Ventus at Castle Oblivion, which she transforms back into the Land of Departure. When she is attacked by Vanitas, Sora rediscovers his power of waking and revives Ventus, who fends Vanitas off.<br><br>The seven guardians arrive at the Keyblade Graveyard to battle the Organization, only to be consumed by a swarm of Heartless summoned by the possessed Terra. Sustained by Kairi's power, Sora awakens in a limbo realm called the Final World, where a Chirithy guides him in restoring his fragmented body. He then uses the power of waking to revive his friends and travel back in time to the moment before their defeat, which is averted by the appearance of Terra's lingering will. In the guardians' ensuing battle against the Organization, Terra regains control of his body and reunites with Aqua and Ventus, while Roxas and Xion—the latter of whom was duplicated as the Organization's final member—regain their hearts from Sora and reunite with Lea.<br><br>After the other Organization members are defeated, Xehanort provokes Sora into attacking him by destroying Kairi's body, allowing Xehanort to acquire the χ-blade and unlock Kingdom Hearts. Sora, Donald, and Goofy hinder Xehanort by transporting him to his boyhood home of Scala ad Caelum, where they eventually defeat him. In Xehanort's dying moments, Eraqus's spirit emerges from Terra and convinces Xehanort to surrender the χ-blade. After sealing Kingdom Hearts, Sora decides to use the power of waking to save Kairi, despite being warned about the grave consequences of doing so. Afterwards, Sora's allies gathers at the Destiny Islands, where a revived Kairi stays beside Sora before he fades away.<br><br>In a post-credits scene, Organization member Xigbar summons the Foretellers and reveals himself to be Luxu, their fellow Keyblade apprentice. In a flashback to their youth, Eraqus and Xehanort—having finished a chess game reminiscent of Sora's final battle with Xehanort—begin a new game that predicts a battle with Luxu and the Foretellers.<br><br>The story opens with the final scenes of Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage, and serves as a conclusion of the "Dark Seeker/Xehanort Saga" that occurs in most preceding games. Most of the worlds featured in the game inspired by Disney properties are new to the series, including the Kingdom of Corona (based on Tangled), Arendelle (Frozen), San Fransokyo (Big Hero 6), and the Pixar-based worlds Toy Box (Toy Story) and Monstropolis (Monsters, Inc.). Two new original worlds created specifically for the game also appear: a limbo for dying hearts called the "Final World"; and Scala ad Caelum, a "seat of power" for past Keyblade wielders, where the game's final battle takes place. Returning Disney worlds include tutorial stage Olympus (Hercules), the Caribbean (Pirates of the Caribbean), and the 100 Acre Wood (Winnie the Pooh), while original worlds include Twilight Town, the Dark World, the Land of Departure, and the Keyblade Graveyard. Worlds such as Yen Sid's Mysterious Tower, Radiant Garden, Disney Castle, and the Destiny Islands appear exclusively via cutscenes. The "Classic Kingdom" mini-games are inspired by classic Walt Disney Productions Mickey Mouse cartoons, including Giantland, The Karnival Kid, Musical Farmer, The Barnyard Battle, The Klondike Kid, and Mickey's Mechanical Man.<br><br>The Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., and Big Hero 6 worlds feature original stories, with the former set between the events of Toy Story 2 and Toy Story 3, and the latter two set after the events of their respective films. This is different from previous worlds in the series, which have often loosely followed plot lines from the films on which they were based, including the Tangled, Frozen, and Pirates of the Caribbean worlds. On the amount of worlds featured in the game, Nomura noted the development team focused on creating "rich gameplay in an individual world... designed so players can take their time and enjoy the gameplay that's available" opposed to having "multiple different little worlds".</div>
