                <h1>The Legend Of Zelda  The Wind Waker</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content">While Link is celebrating his coming of age, a gigantic bird drops pirate captain Tetra into Outset Island's forest. Link rescues Tetra from monsters, but the bird carries off Link's sister Aryll. Tetra agrees to help Link find his sister, and they sail to the Forsaken Fortress, where the bird, the Helmaroc King, has been taking girls with long ears. Link finds Aryll and other kidnapped girls, but the Helmaroc King captures him and takes him to a sinister man in black, who orders Link thrown into the sea.<br><br>Link is rescued at Windfall Island by a talking boat, the King of Red Lions, who explains that the bird's master is a returned Ganon. To defeat him, Link must find the Hero of Time's power, which requires the three Pearls of the Goddesses. Link finds Din's Pearl on Dragon Roost Island, home of the avian Rito and the dragon Valoo; Farore's Pearl in Forest Haven, home of the Great Deku Tree and the plant-like Koroks; and Nayru's Pearl with the water spirit Jabun on Outset Island. The King of Red Lions then takes Link to the Tower of the Gods, where he faces trials before descending beneath the ocean to a castle suspended in time. Here Link finds the Hero of Time's ultimate weapon, the legendary Master Sword.<br><br>Link returns to the Forsaken Fortress. Tetra's crew arrive and rescue Aryll and the girls, but Ganondorf easily overpowers Link and Tetra; the Master Sword has lost its power. Ganondorf recognizes Tetra's Triforce necklace and realizes she is the incarnation of Princess Zelda he is seeking. Link's Rito allies and Valoo save Link and Tetra from Ganondorf. The King of Red Lions brings the two back to the underwater realm, explaining it is the legendary kingdom of Hyrule, which the goddesses submerged long ago to contain Ganondorf while the people fled to the mountaintops. The King of Red Lions reveals himself to be the Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule, the last King of Hyrule, and Tetra is his heir, Princess Zelda, keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom.<br><br>Tetra remains in the castle while Link and the King journey to the two sages who provided the Master Sword's power. They discover Ganondorf's forces murdered them both, so Link must awaken new sages, the Rito Medli and the Korok Makar, and guide them through the Earth and Wind Temples. The sages restore the Master Sword, but the King learns that Ganondorf has survived and abandoned the Forsaken Fortress and fears an attack. They then track down the eight shards of the missing Triforce of Courage, once kept by the Hero of Time, and the gods recognize Link as the Hero of Winds.<br><br>Link and the King return to Hyrule to discover that Ganondorf has captured Tetra. Link follows them to Ganon's tower, defeating Ganondorf's minions before Ganondorf overcomes him. Ganondorf joins Link's and Tetra's Triforce pieces with his own Triforce of Power, forming the complete Triforce, which will grant his wish to rule the world. Before he can act, the King of Hyrule appears and wishes that the Goddesses wash Ganondorf and Hyrule away, and grant Link and Tetra hope for their own future. Link and Tetra battle Ganondorf with the Master Sword and magical arrows as water pours around them; with the final blow, the Master Sword turns Ganondorf to stone. Link and Tetra rise to the surface as the King and Hyrule are submerged. After reuniting with their friends, the heroes sail off to find a new land.</div>
