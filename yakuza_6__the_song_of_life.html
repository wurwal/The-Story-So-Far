                <h1>Yakuza 6  The Song Of Life</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">After recovering from injuries sustained in his fight with Masato Aizawa,[d] Kazuma Kiryu is arrested for his past crimes, and willingly spends three years in prison, hoping for a peaceful life with his fostered children. In his absence, an arson in Kamurocho's Little Asia district skews the criminal underworld's power balance: Daigo Dojima, Taiga Saejima and Goro Majima are framed for the arson and imprisoned; Katsumi Sugai and Takumi Someya usurp the Tojo Clan; the Chinese Saio Triad, specializing in heihaizi human trafficking, rises to power in the area; and the Jingweon Mafia resurfaces, occupying most of Kamurochō.<br><br>Upon release in 2016, Kiryu discovers that Haruka Sawamura hid herself in Onomichi, Hiroshima from the paparazzi after her controversial retirement, and is currently in a coma after a hit and run accident in Kamurochō. Learning that she has an infant son, Haruto, Kiryu travels with the baby to Onomichi. Upon arrival, Kiryu befriends the local Hirose family, its patriarch Toru Hirose, and members Tsuyoshi Nagumo, Naoto Tagashira, Takaaki Matsunaga and Yuta Usami. He also becomes acquainted with a local snack bar owner, Kiyomi Kasahara, who frequently takes care of Haruto.<br><br>Searching for Haruto's father, he meets prominent figures of the Onomichi yakuza world: Takeru Kurusu, real name Heizo Iwami, chairman of the powerful Yomei alliance, and his son Tsuneo Iwami, CEO of his front company, Iwami Shipbuilding. Kiryu also learns that Sugai and Someya initially provoked the war with the Saio Triad in the Tojo Clan's name, which included burning Little Asia, so that Daigo could be framed and arrested. However, the hostility between the gangs became genuine after Iwami empowered the Saio Triad. Iwami later betrayed them and dispatched the Jingweon Mafia to murder Jimmy Lo, the eldest son of their leader, Big Lo. Iwami and the Saio Triad also share the "secret of Onomichi". Likewise, Sugai and Someya want the Saio Triad suppressed, with the latter requesting support from Kiryu. Kiryu rejects the offer because of his role in framing Daigo.<br><br>Hirose eventually reveals that Yuta is Haruto's father, and the youngest son of Big Lo. From birth, Lo's subordinates secretly manipulated Yuta into learning Chinese culture in case his elder brother died, so that he could replace him and reign over the triad, per hereditary succession. After Jimmy Lo's murder, the Saio Triad attempted to kill Haruto because of his mixed bloodline. However, Saio member Shu Tatsukawa and his Jingweon allies decided to sell Haruto to Iwami, who wanted to prove that he has the final authority over them by keeping the child. Tatsukawa convinced Haruka of the plan in Kamurochō but accidentally ran her over during the process. Tatsukawa would later be killed by the Saio for his treachery.<br><br>Iwami later orders the Jingweon Mafia to kidnap Haruto, who is saved by Kiryu and his allies. The Jingweon Mafia's leader, Joongi Han, attempts to reveal Onomichi's secret to Kiryu, but is killed by an unknown assailant. Yuta, disgusted by his father's actions, attempts to commit murder-suicide by burning down Little Asia, but Kiryu saves them both. Big Lo recovers and tells Kiryu that Hirose deliberately told Yuta about his background to provoke him into killing Lo, as he failed to obey Hirose's command to leave Japan, because of his knowledge of the "secret of Onomichi". Realizing that Hirose had been killing anyone connected to the "secret", including Han, Kiryu returns to Onomichi to confront him; the secret is revealed to be a Yamato-class battleship intended for use against the American occupation forces, built illegally by Iwami Shipbuilding. The project was funded by Minoru Daidoji, nicknamed the Fixer, a politician who embezzled taxpayer money from Hiroshima citizens. Kurusu appears and reveals himself as the mastermind behind the murders. He orders Hirose to kill Kiryu and the Hirose Family for exposing the secret but Hirose refuses, resulting in his execution. Daidoji later names Iwami as his new right-hand man and orders him to execute Kurusu, since he failed to execute Kiryu and his allies. Iwami also announces his plan to fully dominate the Yomei Alliance and Tojo Clan.<br><br>Kiryu and his allies assault the Millennium Tower to confront Iwami and Sugai, but Kiryu is forced to fight Someya. Someya's defeat however led to his ex-wife, Kiyomi, being held hostage at gunpoint by Iwami and Sugai, forcing him to commit seppuku to save her. Mourning Someya, Kiryu and the Hirose Family mount a full-scale invasion on the Yomei Alliance. In anticipation, Iwami and Sugai kidnap the awoken Haruka and Haruto. The Hirose Family rescues the two, and a heavily wounded Kiryu defeats Iwami, but is shot by Sugai. Iwami is imprisoned, Daidoji dies of old age, and Sugai commits suicide.<br><br>By January 2017, a politician serving as Daidoji's successor attempts to bribe a recovering Kiryu into silence regarding Daidoji's crimes, which would jeopardize several high-profile politicians. In exchange for his silence, Kiryu demands Daigo's release from imprisonment to prevent a war between the Tojo Clan and Yomei Alliance, and has the politician fake his death to ensure that Haruka and her family can live in peace. After their release from prison, Daigo, Saejima, and Majima create an alliance with the Yomei in honor of Kiryu's will.<br><br>Returning to Okinawa one last time, Kiryu observes the Morning Glory orphanage from a distance, where Haruka, Yuta, Haruto, and the other fostered children live peacefully. As Haruto take his first steps, he sees Kiryu, who disappears before anyone else can spot him.<br><br>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life takes place in winter 2016, and features two major settings: the Kamurochō district of Tokyo, and the Jingaicho district of Onomichi, Hiroshima. Kazuma Kiryu (Takaya Kuroda) returns as the sole playable protagonist, along with several of his allies from previous titles in supporting capacities: Shun Akiyama (Koichi Yamadera), Makoto Date (Kazuhiro Yamaji), Daigo Dojima (Satoshi Tokushige), Goro Majima (Hidenari Ugaki), and Taiga Saejima (Rikiya Koyama). The story is centered around Kiryu's adoptive daughter, Haruka Sawamura (Rie Kugimiya), who has become a mother to an infant child named Haruto. Kiryu sets out to learn the truth about Haruto and the circumstances behind his birth, while being embroiled in a massive conflict between the Tojo Clan and several other crime organizations in Kamurochō and Onomichi.<br><br>Yakuza 6 features a new supporting cast in Onomichi, including: the local yakuza group Hirose Family, consisting of Patriarch Toru Hirose (Beat Takeshi), family captain Tsuyoshi Nagumo (Hiroyuki Miyasako), and members Yuta Usami (Tatsuya Fujiwara), Takaaki Matsunaga (Doronzu Ishimoto), and Naoto Tagashira (Yoshimasa Hosoya); and Kiyomi Kasahara (Yōko Maki), owner of a local snack bar. Opposing Kiryu and his allies are: Takeru Kurusu (Masane Tsukayama), real name Heizo Iwami, chairman of the Yomei Alliance, a Hiroshima-based yakuza organization; Tsuneo Iwami (Nao Ōmori), Kurusu's son and CEO of Iwami Shipbuilding; Kanji Koshimizu (Ayumi Tanida), captain of the Yomei Alliance; Katsumi Sugai (Ryūsei Nakao), acting chairman of the Tojo Clan; Takumi Someya (Shun Oguri), an aspiring Tojo Clan patriarch and Sugai's right-hand man, as well as Kiyomi's ex-husband; Big Lo (Junpei Morita), leader of the Chinese Saio Triad; and Joongi Han[c] (Yuichi Nakamura), leader of the Korean Jingweon Mafia.</div>
