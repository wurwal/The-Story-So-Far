                <h1>Uncharted  The Lost Legacy</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In India, treasure hunter Chloe Frazer (Claudia Black) searches for the legendary tusk of Ganesh, the son of Hindu god Shiva, who lost the tusk while defending his father's temple. Chloe's father was killed by bandits while searching for the tusk. Chloe slips past insurgents and meets up with mercenary Nadine Ross (Laura Bailey). They sneak into the office of the insurgents' leader, Asav (Usman Ally) a former acquaintance of Nadine, who wants to use the tusk to rally India into a civil war. Chloe and Nadine steal a map pointing toward the tusk within the ancient Hoysala Empire and a disc that acts as a key.<br><br>In India's Western Ghats, Chloe and Nadine follow the trail of several towers emblazoned with Hindu weapons: Ganesh's trident, Shiva's bow, and the axe of Parashurama, who used the axe to remove the tusk. The trail leads them to one of Hoysala's two capitals, Halebidu, whose last emperor left to be conquered by the Persians seemingly out of vanity. They realize the emperor left a false trail; the tusk is at the older capital, Belur. On the way there, they escape Asav and his men but lose the disc. While spying on Asav's forces, Nadine sees her old enemy Samuel Drake (Troy Baker); she realizes he is Asav's expert. When she expresses her intention to kill Sam, primarily due to the events that transpired in Libertalia, Chloe reveals she was working with him before he was abducted. Feeling angry and betrayed, Nadine separates from Chloe, but they make amends.<br><br>At Belur, they navigate several puzzles before being captured by Asav, who has realized that Sam is no expert and was misleading them the whole time, forcing Chloe to use the disc to reveal the tusk. In the process, she discovers that Ganesh allowed Parashurama to cut off his tusk; as Shiva gave the axe to him, Ganesh did not want to shame his father by proving the axe useless. Asav triggers a trap and leaves Chloe, Nadine and Sam to drown. Chloe picks the locks on their handcuffs and they escape. Despite tensions between Nadine and Sam, the three chase after Asav to take back the tusk. Nadine is enraged to find that Asav is working with Shoreline, the mercenary group she used to run and from which she was ousted.<br><br>Asav trades the tusk to Orca (Gideon Emery), Nadine's former lieutenant, who now runs Shoreline. Chloe, Nadine and Sam take down Orca's helicopter and learn that Asav traded the tusk for a bomb he plans to detonate in the capital and trigger a civil war. Orca pulls a gun on Nadine, but Sam saves her, allowing her to kill Orca. Commandeering a jeep, the three catch up to the train carrying the bomb. The women board the train and fight through Asav's men. Chloe and Sam switch the tracks, redirecting the train away from the city. In the engine car, Chloe and Nadine fight Asav, whose leg gets trapped under the bomb. They jump to safety before the train falls from a collapsed bridge and explodes, killing Asav. Chloe and Nadine decide to partner up, while Sam reacts with horror at their intentions to donate the tusk to the Ministry of Culture instead of selling it.</div>
