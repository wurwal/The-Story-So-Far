                <h1>Cat Quest</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">The game starts with an opening cutscene showing the hero and his sister on a boat in the open sea. His sister is then abducted by a white cat who destroys the heroâ€™s boat and disappears. While the hero is unconscious, it is revealed that he possesses a strange purple mark on the back of his head. Some time later, the hero washes on the shore of Felingard, an island kingdom ruled by cats. He is awoken by his guardian spirit, Spirry, who takes the hero to a mage to learn what the purple mark means. The mage reveals that the hero is a Dragonblood, one of a group of warriors who defeated Felingard's evil dragons a long time ago, but vanished mysteriously. The hero again encounters the white cat, who is revealed another Dragonblood named Drakoth. Drakoth offers to return the hero's sister if he defeats Felingard's dragons, and the hero resolves to defeat them.<br><br>It is eventually revealed that the Dragonblood were created by a long-dead race of beings called the Old Masters, with the primary creator of the Dragonblood being an Old Master named Aelius. After exploring a number of ruins throughout Felingard, the hero learns that many years ago, the Old Masters turned against Aelius and imprisoned him in a realm called the Zero Dimension. In response, Drakoth led the Dragonblood in a rebellion against the Old Masters, wiping out both races. With Spirry's help, the hero soon defeats Felingard's dragons, but unwittingly follows Drakoth into the Zero Dimension: There, Drakoth reveals that the hero has no sister, and that the opening cutscene was only a false memory created to get the hero to follow him. Spirry admits that Drakoth is actually his master, and that he has been training the hero to get stronger with the goal of luring him into the Zero Dimension. Explaining that the death of a powerful Dragonblood is needed to free Aelius, Drakoth fights the hero, but loses and is slain. The hero and Spirry make amends and flee the collapsing Zero Dimension: At the exit, the two witness Aelius leaving before them.</div>
