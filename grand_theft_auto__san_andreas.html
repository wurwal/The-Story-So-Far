                <h1>Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In 1992, after five years in Liberty City, gangster Carl "CJ" Johnson (Young Maylay) returns to Los Santos following his mother's death in a drive-by shooting. He is intercepted by corrupt C.R.A.S.H. officers led by Frank Tenpenny (Samuel L. Jackson), who threaten to implicate CJ in the killing of a fellow police officer unless he co-operates with them. CJ returns to Grove Street and reunites with his brother Sean "Sweet" Johnson (Faizon Love), sister Kendl Johnson (Yolanda Whittaker), and members of his old gang, Big Smoke (Clifton Powell) and Ryder (MC Eiht). Discovering the Grove Street Families (GSF) have lost much of their territory, CJ restores the gang to power by helping reunite the various GSF sets who had splintered and allying himself with Cesar Vialpando (Clifton Collins Jr.)â€”Kendl's boyfriend and leader of the Varrios Los Aztecas gang. CJ and Cesar witness Smoke and Ryder meeting with Tenpenny and the rival Ballas gang, and discover they betrayed the GSF and were responsible for killing CJ's mother. Suspecting a set-up, CJ rushes to Sweet's aid in a showdown against the Ballas.<br><br>Sweet gets wounded in the ambush and imprisoned, while Tenpenny exiles CJ to the countryside, where he forces him to eliminate witnesses to C.R.A.S.H.'s corruption. CJ befriends a hippie named "the Truth" (Peter Fonda) and Triad leader Wu Zi Mu (James Yaegashi). He participates in a street race and wins a garage in San Fierro, which he sets up to earn money, and crosses paths with the Loco Syndicate, Smoke and Ryder's drug connection. Infiltrating the organisation, he identifies its leader: the mysterious Mike Toreno (James Woods). Alongside Cesar and the Triad, CJ destroys the Loco Syndicate's drug factory and kills their leaders, including Ryder. Toreno, who survived his attack and reveals himself to be an undercover government agent, enlists CJ's help in several shady operations in exchange for Sweet's release from prison. Meanwhile, CJ and Wu Zi Mu establish a casino in Las Venturas, where they clash against a rival, Mafia-run casino.<br><br>After his release, Sweet and CJ revive the GSF, driving off the rival gangs from their territory and rebuilding throughout Los Santos. Tenpenny is arrested and tried for several felonies, but the charges are dropped due to lack of witnesses, prompting a city-wide riot. CJ soon discovers Smoke's hideout. The two engage in a gunfight; CJ wins, and before dying, Smoke confesses that he got caught up with the power and money. Tenpenny arrives, holding CJ at gunpoint while he steals Smoke's drug money, and causes an explosion in the building to escape. He drives off in a fire truck, followed by CJ and Sweet, but eventually loses control of the vehicle and crashes over the side of a bridge overlooking Grove Street. CJ and his friends watch as Tenpenny dies of his injuries. In the aftermath, CJ's family and friends celebrate their success at the Johnson house. In the midst of the celebrations, CJ leaves to check on the neighbourhood.</div>
