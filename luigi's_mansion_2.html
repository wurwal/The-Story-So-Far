                <h1>Luigi'S Mansion 2</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">King Boo, who escaped his painting after the events of the first game, shatters the Dark Moon, a large crystalline object which has a pacifying effect on the ghosts that inhabit Evershade Valley, using the magical jewel embedded in his crown. This causes the ghosts to suddenly become hostile, forcing the Professor to take shelter in a bunker while a dark, eerie fog covers the valley. The Professor immediately contacts Luigi and sends him to the bunker. He tells Luigi to collect the five pieces of the Dark Moon, which have been scattered to different mansions, to clear out the fog and restore peace to Evershade Valley and capture and contain the ghosts before they leave the valley and wreak havoc on the rest of the world. To help Luigi, he provides him with several gadgets: a flashlight; the Poltergust 5000, an upgraded version of the Poltergust 3000; the Dual Scream, a DS-like device used for communication purposes; and the Dark-Light Device, a special lens used for uncovering hidden objects.<br><br>Luigi makes his way through five different mansions in the valley, proceeding to recover Dark Moon pieces from Possessor Ghosts (who have been entrusted by the boos to guard them) in each mansion and saving the professor's Toad assistants, whom King Boo turned into paintings. The Toads produce security images that provide valuable clues, and each image shows two Boos carrying a bag with a painting inside. Eventually, Luigi and the Professor find out that Mario was turned into a painting and that King Boo is behind the whole crisis. However, after Luigi obtains the final Dark Moon piece in a parallel dimension, King Boo intercepts him as he is being returned to the bunker. King Boo reveals to Luigi his intentions to use the corrupted ghosts to conquer the world. Luigi then battles and defeats King Boo.<br><br>When Luigi returns to his world, he frees Mario from the painting and reunites with the Professor and the Toads. They reassemble the Dark Moon, returning the ghosts back to their friendly selves. The professor releases the captured ghosts from the Vault, and they celebrate by taking a photo. The game ends as Luigi returns home with his newly adopted ghost dog, Polterpup. The credits show Mario and Luigi paying visits to Evershade Valley and spending time with the ghosts.</div>
