                <h1>Ratchet & Clank  Rift Apart</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Some time after the events of Into the Nexus, Ratchet and Clank are celebrated as galactic heroes during a parade hosted by Captain Quark, Skid McMarx, and Rusty Pete on Corson V. During it, Clank reveals that he has repaired the Dimensionator, a device capable of opening rifts to other dimensions so that Ratchet can search for the Lombax race and his missing family. However, Doctor Nefarious attacks the parade and attempts to steal the Dimensionator. During the struggle, Ratchet unthinkingly shoots the Dimensionator, which causes dimensional rifts to begin opening randomly. Ratchet, Clank, and Dr. Nefarious are transported to an alternate universe, where the Dimensionator explodes, damaging the fabric of space and time and separating the three. Clank awakens to find himself alone and now missing his right arm from the blast. He is discovered and picked up by a female Lombax named Rivet. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefarious ends up in a throne room, where he is mistaken for Emperor Nefarious, an alternate version of himself who, unlike him, has never been defeated and rules over the galaxy. Ratchet, elsewhere, finds himself alone and starts his search for Clank. With the emperor currently absent on a conquest, Dr. Nefarious secretly assumes his identity and sends his new minions after Ratchet and Rivet.<br><br>While searching, Ratchet witnesses Rivet escaping the planet with Clank. Ratchet encounters Phantom (the alternate Skidd), a member of the Resistance opposed to Emperor Nefarious, which Rivet is a part of, who gifts him an electronic helper named Glitch to help him get a ship to follow her. Rivet takes Clank to her hideout on Sargasso to interrogate him, not believing his words about the dimensional rifts due to her distrust in robots. They discover a dimensional anomaly on the planet which Clank investigates, making contact with a prophet named Gary, who enlists his help in repairing other dimensional anomalies to prevent the Dimensional Cataclysm. Rivet learns the truth by looking into Clank's memories and repairs Clank's communicator so they are able to get in contact with Ratchet and come up with a plan to rebuild the Dimensionator so they can return to their own home dimension and stop the Dimensional Cataclysm.<br><br>Ratchet heads out to find the blueprint for the Dimensionator, and recruits one of Gary's robot apprentices, Kit, to be his partner. Kit warns Ratchet that she is a Warbot built by Emperor Nefarious and worries she might lose control of her programming and attack him, but Ratchet reassures her that they make a good team. They then head to a secret lab on Cordelion to forge a new Dimensionator, while Rivet and Clank head out to Blizar Prime to gather the Phase Quartz needed to power it. After it is accidentally destroyed, the two search for the mythical Fixer on Torren IV who can repair anything and convince him to overcome his own self-doubt to repair the Phase Quartz. Ratchet and Rivet then finally meet in the Scarstu Debris Field, with Clank reuniting with Ratchet and Kit agreeing to become Rivet's partner. They complete the Dimensionator, only for Dr. Nefarious to arrive and steal it. Dr. Nefarious is defeated in battle, but the real Emperor Nefarious arrives, easily defeating Ratchet and Rivet and stealing the Dimensionator for himself, which he plans to use to eliminate Captain Quantum (the alternate Captain Qwark) and destroy the Resistance once and for all.<br><br>Rivet pursues Emperor Nefarious, but he uses the Dimensionator to banish her to a pocket dimension. As Rivet searches for a rift to escape through, she tells Kit about how she lost her arm to a Warbot attack, with Kit realizing she was the one responsible. Meanwhile Ratchet heads out to Ardolis to try and warn Captain Quantum, but fails to stop Emperor Nefarious from banishing Captain Quantum through a rift. Emperor Nefarious celebrates finally conquering the universe but doesn't feel fulfilled until he realizes he can use the Dimensionator to conquer every dimension. Spying on Emperor Nefarious using a device that Quantum bugged on him, Ratchet and Rivet realize Emperor Nefarious will need the Dimensional Map and head out to intercept him. Rivet and Kit board Emperor Nefarious' flagship and rescue Gary, who reveals he hid the Dimensional Map inside a dimensional anomaly. Ratchet and Clank recover the Dimensional Map but are ambushed by Emperor Nefarious and banished through a rift. Kit transforms into her Warbot form to try and stop Emperor Nefarious, shocking Rivet, but Kit ends up being banished through a rift as well.<br><br>Left alone, Rivet heads to Viceron for the prison facility Emperor Nefarious has banished all of his enemies to and stages a prison break, freeing Ratchet and Clank as well as the rest of the Resistance. However, still feeling guilty over causing the loss of Rivet's arm, Kit decides to leave the group. As the Resistance regroups, Emperor Nefarious announces that he plans to start invading other dimensions, starting with Ratchet and Clank's home dimension. Ratchet, Clank, Rivet, and the Resistance pursue Emperor Nefarious through the rift. Ratchet and Clank destroy Emperor Nefarious' giant power suit, and Kit returns to hold his forces at bay while Rivet confronts Emperor Nefarious personally. Working together, everybody, including Dr. Nefarious, who grew irritated over how his other self treated him, defeat and send Emperor Nefarious to his demise through a rift. Clank recovers the Dimensionator and uses it to repair the dimensions, averting the Dimensional Cataclysm. Rivet and Kit repair their relationship, and before they are sent back to their dimension, Ratchet asks them if they would like to make "one stop" first.<br><br>During the credits segment, citizens of Nefarious City are seen dismantling the regime's legacy, Dr. Nefarious reunites with Lawrence, who is now a father, and Gary shares his findings with his father, the Plumber. With reality saved and the Dimensionator in their possession, Ratchet, Clank, Rivet, and Kit take the opportunity to hang out together, repair the damage Emperor Nefarious caused, build a new arm for Clank, and go on further adventures.</div>
