                <h1>Visions Of Mana</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">A prologue shows Eoren and his lover Lysa, the Alm of Earth, attempting to escape Gudju; they fail and Lysa is petrified. Later, Hinna is chosen as the Alm of Fire, with Val becoming her Soul Guard. As they journey towards the Mana Tree, they join up with Careena and Morley, and aid Palamena in protecting Illystana from an attempted coup by the magistrate Passar. Along the way they gain the aid of the Elementals, who choose Careena, Moreley and Palamena as the Alms of Wind, the Moon, and Water respectively. They also meet with Eoren, who tells them a story of a time when Alms were not needed and the legend of the Mana Sword wielded by the Goddess's chosen hero. After helping Palamena, Eoren tricks Val and Hinna into going with him, then kills Hinna to gain her corestone—a crystallization of life essence—to awaken the Mana Sword and release Lysa from petrification. Initially in shock, Val decides to continue guarding the other Alms and hoping to find a way to restore Hinna. During this next journey they make contact with Aesh, who eventually is chosen as the Alm of Shadow.<br><br>When they reach the Sanctuary of Mana, they meet with Julei, who is chosen as the Alm of Wood. Attempting to reach the Mana Tree, they run into Eoren as he uses Hinna's corestone to awaken the Mana Sword, which releases Daelophos from a stone prison. Daelophos takes the Mana Sword and releases the Benevodons to reclaim parts of his old power, killing Eoren and Lysa in the process. The group begin defeating the Benevodons, during which Val is chosen as the Alm of Light. Wishing to learn Daelophos's goals, the group return to the Mana Tree to meet with Khoda, spirit of the first Soul Guard and Val's ancestor. From Khoda and memories in ancient ruins, the group learn that the fragmented realms of Fa'Diel were merged into Qi'Diel when a war depleted the flow of Mana, unleashing the enraged Benevodons. Daelophos became the Goddess's champion and sealed away the Benevodons, but his lover Cerulia was murdered, driving him to seek revenge on humanity by killing the Goddess before Khoda sacrificed himself to seal Daelophos away. The Alms' sacrifices sustained the sleeping Goddess, who lost her strength preserving the merged world and suppressing Daelophos's anger, until someone would come with the will to create a new fate for Qi'Diel.<br><br>With all the Benevodons defeated and their will to better the world determined, the party confront Daelophos, but are unable to defeat him; he breaks the Mana Sword before leaving for the Sanctuary. The group pursue and defeat Daelophos by the Tree of Mana, and Val strikes the final blow with the Mana Sword, repaired by the dead within the Mana Tree including Hinna and Eoren. Daelophos concedes, reuniting with Cerulia's spirit before the two pass on, with the awakened Goddess promising they will reunite in new lives. Val uses the Mana Sword's power to wish for a world where Alms are not needed. Mid and post-credit scenes show Mana flowing freely through the world again; Morley, Careena, Palamena and Aesh helping with reconstruction, and Val dying of old age after a long life of adventure and reuniting with Hinna as the Goddess of Mana. A post-game scenario follows the group before the final battle as Passar attempts another coup using the dark dragon Aeve Zalaha; Aeve Zalaha awakens, killing Passar, but the party defeats him.<br><br>Visions of Mana takes place in the fantasy world Qi'Diel, a land of different coexisting species sustained by the Mana Tree, incarnation of the Goddess of Mana. Every four years, a being dubbed the Faerie travels to villages tied to the Elementals, spirits tied to the flow of Mana, and chooses one resident as an "Alm" who will go on a pilgrimage to restore the flow of Mana through their sacrifice, travelling under the guardianship of a Soul Guard soldier.<br><br>The main protagonists are Val, a warrior from the Fire Village of Tianeea who becomes Soul Guard to Hinna, a childhood friend chosen to undergo the pilgrimage to the Mana Tree as the Alm of Fire. Their other companions are Morley, a cat demi-human from Etaern who seeks to overcome a traumatic event from his past; Careena, a spirited dragon demi-human from Longren; Palamena, queen of the water capital Illystana; and the sproutling Julei. Other characters include Eoren, a traveller from the Earth Village Gudju: Aesh, an enthusiastic scholar; and Daelophos, a legendary champion of the Goddess of Mana. The Benevodons, eight elemental monsters from the distant past, serve as antagonists.</div>
