                <h1>The Walking Dead (Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated animate__slower">The following summary is a broad overview of the work, describing the major events that occur regardless of player choice. Some specific elements not listed here will change based on the impact of player choices.<br><br>Lee is on his way to prison when the police car transporting him crashes after hitting a walker. After killing the reanimated cop, he flees a group of walkers, and while taking shelter in a suburban home, meets Clementine, whose parents had traveled to Savannah. The two are picked up by Shawn Greene (voiced by Peter Edward Mussad) and taken to the farm of his father, Hershel (Chuck Kourouklis), meeting a fisherman named Kenny, his wife Katjaa, and their son Duck. After Shawn is killed by walkers, Hershel evicts the others. The group travels to Macon, Lee's hometown, where they join another group led by Lilly barricaded in Lee's family's pharmacy, which includes Glenn. While helping the group secure medical supplies and gasoline, Lee finds his parents and brother are dead. After the death of one of their own, the group is forced to flee to a nearby defensible motel to stay, though Glenn departs to find friends in Atlanta.<br><br>Three months later, the group is running low on supplies. They encounter a group of survivors attacked by walkers, and learn from the death of one of them that everyone is already infected and they do not need to be bitten to turn after dying. They take the offer of providing gasoline to the St. Johns, who run a nearby dairy farm, in exchange for food, but discover that the family has engaged in cannibalism. Losing two of their own, including Lilly's father Larry, the group overcomes the St. Johns and leaves the farm to be overridden by walkers. On their way back to the motel, they come across a car packed with provisions, and with no one around but them, they ransack it. Sometime later, the motel is attacked by bandits, which draws a walker horde. The group escapes, though Duck is bitten by a walker. Lilly, having become unstable due to losing her father, kills one of the others and eventually separates from the group. Lee's group travels to Savannah via train with plans to find a boat to escape the mainland, but before they head to Savannah, Lee encounters Chuck, a wise and resourceful homeless survivor living in a boxcar, who advises Lee to teach Clementine self-defense using guns and shooting techniques and to cut her hair to avoid being easily grabbed by walkers. En route, Duck succumbs to the bite, driving Katjaa to suicide. Near Savannah, Lee's group meets a couple, Omid and Christa, who join them. Clementine's walkie-talkie goes off, and a man tells her he has her parents in Savannah.<br><br>In Savannah, Chuck is killed after they are attacked by walkers, and the group sets up shelter in an abandoned mansion. Lee and Kenny go to River Street and discover that all the boats have been taken or destroyed, and useful supplies have been scavenged by the walled community, Crawford. Separated from the others by walkers, Lee meets another group of survivors led by Vernon, who helps him return to the mansion, where they discover a parked motorboat in a backyard shed. Lee and the others lead a raid on Crawford for supplies but discover the whole community has been overrun by walkers. When they are attacked by walkers, they escape but lose at least one of their own. Once they return to the mansion, Vernon leaves to return to his group but tells Lee he does not think he is fit to be a guardian for Clementine.<br><br>Desperate to find her parents, Clementine goes missing. In his haste to find her, Lee is bitten by a walker. Realizing his time is short, he tries to find Vernon's group but finds they have stolen the boat. Clementine tells Lee over the walkie-talkie that the stranger is holding her at a downtown hotel, the same that Clementine's parents were staying at. Lee's group takes to the rooftops to avoid the walkers in the streets, but Kenny is seemingly lost after saving another member. The remaining survivors, Lee, Omid and Christa, head to the hotel, but are separated when a sign used to cross a street full of walkers collapses. Lee continues alone to find Clementine held captive by the stranger, who reveals himself to be the owner of the car the group had previously ransacked, which caused the death of his family. Lee and Clementine kill the stranger, and the two cover themselves in walker guts to mask their scent from the horde roaming outside. While in the streets, Clementine sees her zombified parents, and drags a weakening Lee into an abandoned store. After working together to kill a walker, Lee tells Clementine to escape the city and find Omid and Christa. Lee can ask Clementine to kill him before he turns or to leave him behind to turn. If he does not decide, Clementine will choose herself based on Lee's previous actions. In a post-credits scene, Clementine, who has escaped the city, sees two figures in the distance who notice her.</div>
