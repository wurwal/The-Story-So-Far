                <h1>Like A Dragon  Infinite Wealth</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In 2022, three years after the joint dissolution of the Tojo Clan and Omi Alliance,[c] ex-yakuza Ichiban Kasuga is now an employee at Hello Work employment agency in Isezaki Ijincho, Yokohama, determined to carry on his father Masumi Arakawa's legacy by helping fellow ex-yakuza find legitimate work. After a hangout with his friends Yu Nanba, Koichi Adachi, and Saeko Mukoda, Kasuga asks Saeko out on a date but overdoes it by proposing marriage to her, resulting in the pair becoming estranged.<br><br>One year later, VTuber Hisoka Tatara spreads false rumors of Kasuga building his own crime ring from ex-yakuza members, which gets Kasuga and Nanba fired from their jobs, and Adachi unable to take loans from the bank. A month later, the three of them learn that the Seiryu Clan has been recruiting ex-yakuza en masse. They infiltrate the Seiryu Clan HQ and meet their Acting Chairman, Masataka Ebina, who reveals that he is hiring ex-yakuza into a legitimate waste management business and that he is organizing a "Second Great Dissolution" to disband the remaining yakuza clans across Japan. Ebina informs them that he is working with Jo Sawashiro, who has been released from prison after being proven innocent, with the former's help, in the murder of the previous Seiryu Clan Chairman Ryuhei Hoshino.[d] Sawashiro reveals to Kasuga that his biological mother, Akane Kishida, is alive and has been living in Honolulu, Hawaii, and asks Kasuga to meet her.<br><br>Upon arriving in Hawaii, Kasuga quickly befriends the wheelchair-bound engineer Eiji Mitamura. Kasuga has run-ins with taxi driver Eric Tomizawa, who attempts to rob him, and later with Akane's maid and exchange student Chitose Fujinomiya, who strips him naked and steals his passport. After escaping the police to evade capture, Kasuga is unexpectedly reunited with Kazuma Kiryu, who is looking for Akane per the Daidoji faction's orders. While investigating Akane's house, Kasuga and Kiryu are confronted by the Yamai Syndicate and their patriarch, Yutaka Yamai, who is also searching for Akane. Tomizawa, who is coerced to work for Yamai, defects to Kasuga's side. Kasuga's group discovers that Chitose used Kasuga's passport to hide within District Five, home of the Barracudas gang. Kiryu reveals that he has cancer, contracted from an accident at a nuclear waste disposal plant in 2020, and he has only six months left to live.<br><br>The party infiltrates District Five and finds Chitose, who joins them to confront the Barracudas leader Dwight Méndez. Gaining intel from Chitose, the party discovers that Akane was part of a religious charity group called Palekana and that two of Hawaii's largest gangs, the Barracudas and the Chinese Ganzhe Mafia, along with the smaller-sized Yamai Syndicate, are all after Akane. With the help of Kiryu's handler Kihei Hanawa, Kasuga confronts Wong Tou, the commander of the Ganzhe, and learns that the Barracudas and the Ganzhe are secretly controlled by Bryce Fairchild, the Sage of Palekana and "the Overseer" of Hawaii's underworld. Bryce is hunting down Akane to find Lani, a young girl currently under her protection. Wong is then betrayed by a spy, forcing Kasuga and his party to escort Wong to safety, but not before Kiryu is captured by Yamai. Nanba and Adachi, having arrived in Hawaii, join Kasuga and the group to confront Yamai, who was providing medical care to Kiryu, out of respect as a fellow former Tojo Clan member. Learning of Bryce's true objective, Yamai calls off his pursuit of Akane. Kiryu is then convinced to return to Japan with Nanba for recovery, while Kasuga confronts Bryce, who escapes.<br><br>Returning to Kasuga's apartment in Ijincho, Nanba is joined by Geomijul and Yokohama Liumang leader Seonhee, and later Saeko, all of whom help Kiryu recover and manage his condition. Seonhee is later informed that the Seiryu Clan is planning to expand its waste management operations to Hawaii. Kiryu meets Ebina and Sawashiro at the former Tojo Clan Headquarters. Ebina reveals he got the idea for his waste management business from Palekana, who runs a similar business on Nele Island and plans to partner with them. However, they claim they have no knowledge of Palekana hunting Akane. Later, Kiryu and his party are taken by surprise when Tatara publicly exposes Kiryu's survival to the world and claims he plans to resurrect the Tojo Clan, seemingly corroborated by Ebina and Sawashiro.<br><br>Back in Hawaii, Kasuga is able to locate Akane and Lani hiding in a yacht offshore. En route to a Daidoji safehouse, Akane reveals that Lani is the last surviving member of the Mililani family, the true successor to the title of Sage of Palekana, and that Bryce usurped the position by murdering the previous Sage. Upon reaching the safehouse, Chitose reveals that Eiji is a Seiryu Clan spy, who faked his disability to gain Kasuga's trust. The Barracudas raid the safehouse, resulting in Hanawa and Wong's deaths, while Eiji escapes with Lani. Chitose then confesses that she is Tatara, having been blackmailed by Eiji to spread online accusations against ex-yakuza across the country and serve as a spy on Kasuga's party. Kasuga focuses on rescuing Lani, while Kiryu focuses on Sawashiro.<br><br>Former Liumang leader Tianyou Zhao joins forces with Kiryu's party as they confront Sawashiro, who reveals that he has been secretly working behind Ebina's back to actually carry out the Second Great Dissolution, honoring Arakawa's legacy. He realizes that Ebina's plan is a ruse after sending Kasuga to Hawaii, and that Ebina used Kasuga to lure Akane as a favor for Bryce. Ebina plans to make a deal with Bryce to store all of Japan's accumulated nuclear waste on Nele Island, allowing the government to resume Japan's nuclear industry. Sawashiro and Kiryu, however, share the belief that there's an ulterior motive behind Ebina's plans. Kasuga learns from surviving Daidoji agents that Eiji used to be a reporter who was framed by the Arakawa family for a hit-and-run. Harboring resentment for the yakuza, he joined the non-profit anti-crime organization Bleach Japan prior to its fall following Ryo Aoki's death. Chitose makes amends with the party as they attempt to rescue Lani, but fail as Eiji flees with her.<br><br>Sawashiro requests Kiryu to seek out former Tojo Clan leaders Daigo Dojima, Taiga Saejima, and Goro Majima to help with the Second Great Dissolution. Kiryu meets them, where they reveal that a prior Tatara Channel exposé on their ex-yakuza employees caused their security company to go under. Daigo also reveals that Ebina may be Arakawa's illegitimate son and Kasuga's half-brother. Arakawa, who was in an arranged marriage to Ebina's mother, the daughter of the Hikawa Family patriarch, was unaware of her pregnancy before he went on a rampage against the Hikawa Family for hunting down Akane on the day of Kasuga's birth. Fearing another failure, Daigo, Saejima, and Majima refuse to help Sawashiro. Tatara, replaced with a substitute by Eiji, exposes the meeting, causing public backlash and a manhunt for Kiryu. That night, Tatara holds a live stream at the former Tojo HQ with Ebina and Sawashiro, where Ebina announces his deal with Palekana, the dissolution of the Seiryu Clan, the reformation of Bleach Japan, and his plan to pass their yakuza rehabilitation program to the government. Kiryu and his party raid the former Tojo HQ, but find that the live stream was pre-recorded and that it is a trap to further expose Kiryu.<br><br>Joongi Han, Seonhee's right-hand man, arrives in Hawaii to help Kasuga find a way to Nele Island. Kasuga's party investigates a secret passage within District Five, which leads to a hidden port heading to Nele Island. Lani is rescued from the Barracudas, and with Yamai's help, the party, Lani and Akane escape to Japan. Having failed Bryce, Dwight attempts to escape but is eaten by a shark. Upon arriving in Japan, the party is greeted by Kiryu's friend, Detective Makoto Date, who reveals that in exchange for a passage back to Japan, Yamai would confess to the murder of Shuji Tabata, Yamai's former patriarch. Yamai flees to visit his former matriarch Yui Tabata, who framed him for the murder, but learns that she is dying from Alzheimer's. Yamai bids her farewell and turns himself in.<br><br>With Lani and Akane safe in Japan, Kasuga and Kiryu regroup in Ijincho, where Ebina contacts them, saying that the rehabilitation program has been approved by the government, then reveals that he has Sawashiro hostage at the Millennium Tower in Kamurocho, Tokyo. The group then splits up: Kasuga's group returns to Hawaii to stop Bryce, while Kiryu's group makes their way to Millennium Tower to save Sawashiro. In Hawaii, Kasuga and his party assault Nele Island and discover a natural cave filled with barrels of nuclear waste, revealing Palekana's waste disposal facility a lie. Kasuga confronts Bryce, who reveals his plan to use the island to store many nations' darkest secrets and gain global influence. Kasuga defeats him, and Chitose livestreams the entire facility's nuclear waste and confesses to being Tatara. Bryce attempts to commit suicide after admitting defeat, but Kasuga stops him.<br><br>Shortly after Chitose's confession, Kiryu and his party assault the Millennium Tower with surprise aid from Daigo, Saejima, and Majima. Kiryu and his party confront Ebina and find a battered and barely alive Sawashiro. Having a grudge against Arakawa and the entire yakuza, Ebina reveals his actual plan behind the Palekana deal: to force the yakuza to work on Nele Island's nuclear waste disposal, slowly torturing and killing them with radiation poisoning. Kiryu defeats Ebina, and as he sympathizes with his anger, begs him to give the yakuza a chance to atone. Kiryu then falls unconscious and is evacuated to a hospital. Meanwhile, Kasuga tracks down an injured Eiji hiding in Kamurocho, and convinces him to turn himself in.<br><br>A month later, the public has largely forgotten Bryce, Ebina, and Eiji's crimes and moves on to the next controversy. Tomizawa decides to devote more time to helping the homeless in Hawaii, Chitose becomes the chairwoman of her family business, and Lani chooses to embrace her role as Sage to rebuild Palekana with Akane's assistance. Kasuga attempts to properly confess his feelings for Saeko; she reciprocates, but Kasuga messes up again by revealing a T-shirt declaring their relationship, much to their friends' amusement. Meanwhile, Kiryu's adopted daughter Haruka Sawamura and her son Haruto visit Kiryu at the hospital just as he's about to receive treatment. When the doctor asks to confirm his name, Kiryu, no longer needing to fake his death, answers with his real name.</div>
