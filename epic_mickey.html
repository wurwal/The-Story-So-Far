                <h1>Epic Mickey</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Mickey Mouse, out of curiosity, enters Yen Sid's workshop through a magic mirror in his house and discovers the model of a world resembling Disneyland that Yen Sid created for things that have been forgotten, and the Magic Paintbrush, the tool used to create it. Mickey examines the model after Yen Sid leaves, not knowing what it actually is, and starts fiddling with the brush to make a self-portrait of himself, but accidentally creates a monster made of the paint and thinner. Mickey panics when the ink monster tries to attack him and throws thinner on it in an attempt to erase it, but spills more paint and thinner on the model in the process. Upon seeing Yen Sid approaching, Mickey quickly tries to clean up the mess, but in his haste, spills the entire thinner bottle onto the paint spillage as he flees back to his house. The monster, having survived Mickey's attempt to destroy it, enters the model through a portal created by the paint and thinner mixture, taking the bottle of thinner with it. Yen Sid arrives too late before he could do anything, and deems the world he created had become a "wasteland".<br><br>After many decades of fame following the incident, Mickey has forgotten about what had happened until what appears to be the ink monster enters his home through the mirror and abducts him, bringing him into the ruined, forgotten world, now known as Wasteland. After waking up, Mickey finds himself strapped to a table in a huge laboratory in Dark Beauty Castle by the Mad Doctor, who plans to steal Mickey's heart by using a large mechanical arm. However, Mickey frees himself before he can succeed and scares off the monster with Yen Sid's brush, which had also fallen into Wasteland, forcing the Mad Doctor to flee. Oswald, who was secretly spying on them the whole time, attempts to follow the Mad Doctor after he escapes, but accidentally breaks a lever on the main controls for the mechanical arm, causing it to malfunction and become hostile, leaving Mickey to deal with it.<br><br>Gus, the leader of the Gremlins, suddenly arrives and helps Mickey disable the mechanical arm and escape out of Dark Beauty Castle. Gus explains to Mickey on the way out that the ink monster is called the Shadow Blot and is made of paint and thinner. Mickey also discovers that he mixed with some of the Blot's ink, causing ink to drip off of him. Gus teaches Mickey how to use the Magic Brush, which allows Mickey to spray paint and thinner that can be used to erase or paint in toon objects and fight Blotlings, the Blot's spawn, and Beetleworx, the Mad Doctor's evil creations. After traveling through the World of Gremlins, based on It's a Small World, he confronts the Clock Tower, now driven insane after hearing the song "It's a Small World" non-stop for years. From there he arrives to Mean Street, where many of Wasteland's inhabitants reside. There, he learns that Wasteland was once a safe and happy place until an event called the Thinner Disaster occurred, which permanently damaged the world and made many areas dangerous, followed by the arrival of the Blot. After locating Oswald at his sanctuary in Mickeyjunk Mountain, Mickey discovers that the only way a cartoon character can escape Wasteland is with a heart. He also learns that Oswald believes that Mickey stole his life and heavily resents him, but he reluctantly agrees to help Mickey escape since he still has his heart. To do so, they journey to the Moonliner Rocket at Tomorrow City, only for them to discover that the Mad Doctor had stolen essential parts from it to use for his evil plans, so Oswald sends Mickey and Gus to collect them. Tho duo retrieve the first part after defeating the thinner corrupted Petetronic, an incarnation of Pete based on Sark from Tron, the next after defeating an animatronic version of Captain Hook in Ventureland, and then confront the Mad Doctor in Lonesome Manor. After defeating him, it is revealed that the Mad Doctor turned himself into an animatronic, which would allow him to survive the Blot's revolt and rule over the remaining inhabitants of Wasteland, before he is sent flying after Gus removes the last rocket part from his hovercraft.<br><br>After acquiring all the parts, Oswald has Mickey help repel a Blot attack on the summit of Mickeyjunk Mountain. Once the threat is neutralized, Oswald reveals to Mickey that the Blot that he had just battled, along with all of the Blotlings Mickey had encountered, were only drippings of the real Blot. Oswald explains that he and his girlfriend, Ortensia, managed to seal the Blot away in the bottle of thinner many years ago, but Ortensia was blighted by the monster in the process and entered an inert state. Oswald then decides that he had been too hostile towards Mickey and attempts to start over and become friends with him. Mickey becomes overwhelmed with guilt and confesses to Oswald that he was the cause of the Blot's existence and the Thinner Disaster, which causes Oswald to lose his temper and jump on top of the cork sealing the thinner bottle shut, challenging Mickey to a fight. The cork sealing the bottle suddenly breaks, allowing the Blot to escape from its imprisonment. The Blot, which has grown into an enormous monster, captures Oswald and Gus and threatens to kill them if Mickey does not allow it to take his heart. Mickey yields his heart to the Blot, who then lets Oswald and Gus go and proceeds to go on a rampage throughout Wasteland, using ink tentacles called bloticles to absorb paint and become more powerful before moving on to Mickey's world to wreak havoc there.<br><br>After eliminating the bloticles, Mickey, Oswald and Gus attempt to use the now fixed rocket to reach the Blot, but end up crashing the rocket into Dark Beauty Castle after the Blot absorbs the rocket's paint. The group make their way to the fireworks control room at the center of the castle, where they defeat the Blot's forces before it captures Oswald, Gus, and the inert Ortensia, forcing Mickey to enter the Blot's body to save them. Mickey regains his heart before he and Oswald successfully manage to destroy the Blot with a paint-laden firework display from the castle and are sent flying. Oswald and Ortensia land in Mean Street while Mickey is sent flying through a portal in the sky above the castle that takes him out of Wasteland and back to Yen Sid's workshop. With the Blot destroyed, Wasteland begins regenerating as paint rains down from the sky and Oswald reunites with Ortensia, who has been revived by the paint. As Mickey returns home, Yen Sid enchants the mirror to show Mickey the positive or negative outcomes of his major choices in Wasteland and allows him to communicate with Oswald one last time, the duo now bonding as brothers. Afterwards, Yen Sid seals the mirror to prevent Mickey from re-entering his workshop and causing any more mischief. Not long after the mirror is sealed, Mickey discovers that he still has some of the Blot's ink in him, leaving the possibility he may still be able to reach Wasteland.<br><br>The game is set in the Wasteland, a pen-and-paper stylized world, created in the game's narrative by the sorcerer Yen Sid, as a place for "forgotten things", namely disused or obscure Disney characters. It is physically inspired by Disneyland, and appears as an intricate model in Yen Sid's workshop. However, Mickey Mouse's fiddling with Yen Sid's paintbrush causes mass damage to the model, turning Wasteland into a post-apocalyptic landscape. The land is tormented by the Blot, a monstrous being which Mickey accidentally created using the brush and is loosely based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey in the comic strips created by Floyd Gottfredson, as well as the Mad Doctor.<br><br>Wasteland is split into several locations based on various areas from Disneyland and other Disney theme parks. Dark Beauty Castle is based on Sleeping Beauty Castle, Mean Street is based on Main Street, U.S.A., where Horace Horsecollar and Pete live, though other incarnations of the latter appear through the game. The Gremlin Village is inspired by Fantasyland, based primarily around It's A Small World. The attraction's iconic clock tower serves as the game's first boss. Mickeyjunk Mountain is based on the Matterhorn Bobsleds, and is covered in discarded Mickey Mouse toys and merchandise. Other locations include Bog Easy, based on New Orleans Square, which is home to the Lonesome Manor, based on The Haunted Mansion, Ventureland, based on Adventureland, Tomorrow City, based on Tomorrowland, and OsTown, based on Mickey's Toontown, where Clarabelle Cow lives.<br><br>The game also features animatronic versions of characters, three of which are counterparts of Daisy Duck, Donald Duck and Goofy.</div>
