                <h1>The Legend Of Heroes  Trails Through Daybreak</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In the year 1208, thanks to postwar reparations, the Calvard Republic experiences unprecedented economic growth while continuously dealing with public unrest caused by immigration and new governmental reforms. In a corner of the city of Edith, a young man known as Van Arkride is working at Arkride Solutions Office as a Spriggan, a bounty hunter and private detective. One day, Van is approached by Agnès Claudel, a high school student and the daughter of Calvard's new president Roy Gramheart. She asks for his help to find orbments called the Oct-Genesis, the last creation of her late great-grandfather Claude Epstein, one of the greatest scientists in history. Along the way they are joined by Feri Al-Fayed, a jaeger of the Kruga clan; Aaron Wei, a performer in Langport; Risette Twinings, an employee of a private military company; Quatre Salision, a pupil of Professor Hamilton who is one of Professor Epstein's disciples; Judith Ranster, a famous actor who has a secret identity as the Phantom Thief Grimcats; and Bergard Zeman (Gunther Barkhorn), Van's mentor and a knight of the Church who was presumed dead. Their search for the Oct-Genesis brings them into conflict with the terrorist group Almata led by Gerard Dantès. The Arkride Solutions Office align themselves with other factions such as the Bracers, the government, and even criminal organizations like Ouroboros and Heiyue against Almata, which itself is aided by Garden, a secret organization formed by Ellroy Harwood, the Fourth Anguis of Ouroboros who combined the remains of the D∴G cult in Crossbell with the remains of the group he formerly belonged to, the Order of the Moonlight Horse. Van also reunites with Elaine Auclair, a bracer who is his childhood friend and former lover and René Kincaid, a government secretary who is his and Elaine's childhood friend.<br><br>It is revealed that Van has become the host of one of the five demon lords known as Vagrants Diaspora when he was young (which allows him to take a monstrous form known as Grendel) and became a test subject of the D∴G cult under the supervision of Gerard Dantès who was its high priest at the time. Using this position, Gerard claimed the power for himself and escaped the cult's extermination. He then took over the leadership of Almata to spread fear and strengthen the demonic power. It is also revealed that Gerard is actually a descendant of the Eldarion family, Calvard's fallen royalty.<br><br>Van and his team face and kill Gerard, but he and other deceased members of Almata are revived by one of his subordinates named Melchior. The Spriggans face Gerard again who transforms into a demon. Van takes the demonic power back from him, killing him for good. Giving the last Oct-Genesis they found back to Agnès, Van becomes Vagrants Diaspora and imprisons himself in another plane to save humanity, but his team, with the help of his orbment's artificial intelligence Mare, reach Van's prison realm, saves him and together, defeat the demon lord.</div>
