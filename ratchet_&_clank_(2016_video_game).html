                <h1>Ratchet & Clank (2016 Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Prisoner Shiv Helix is being moved to a joint cell with the newly imprisoned Captain Qwark, former commander of the legendary Galactic Rangers. As Shiv happens to be a huge fan of Qwark, he reveals that a "hologame" is being made based on his last adventure. Eager for attention, Qwark agrees to tell Shiv his side of the story.<br><br>On planet Veldin, Ratchet, a young Lombax who works as a mechanic, dreams of joining the Rangers. Despite passing all of their tests with flying colors, the Rangers refuse to accept him after learning of his criminal past. Meanwhile, in a factory on planet Quartu, Chairman Alonzo Drek of the Blarg oversees the construction of a mechanical army with his ally Dr. Nefarious, an evil scientist who was presumed dead after his defeat at the hands of the Rangers. However, a defective warbot manages to escape using a stolen ship. After the ship crashes on Veldin, Ratchet rescues the defective bot, who explains that he needs to warn the Galactic Rangers of Drek's plans. Ratchet names him "Clank" and offers to take him to the Ranger Headquarters on planet Kerwan. Traveling to Kerwan, they discover that Drek and his Blarg soldiers have already invaded the planet. The duo successfully foil an attempt by the invaders to destroy the Hall of Heroes by ramming it with a train loaded with explosives. As a reward for their assistance, Qwark reluctantly allows them to join the Rangers. As new Rangers, the duo lead many successful operations against the Blarg, but the insecure Qwark soon becomes jealous of Ratchet, whose popularity starts to overshadow his own fame.<br><br>Qwark calls a meeting of the Rangers to organize a direct assault on Quartu. The assault is successful, and the Rangers learn from Drek's files that the Blarg's true plan is to use the Deplanetizer, a weaponized space station created by Nefarious, to destroy several planets so that he can harvest their remains and build a new home world for his people. Learning that the next target is Novalis, Qwark leaves to personally negotiate with Drek while the other Rangers battle his forces outside the station. During the fighting, Ratchet enters the Deplanetizer and tries to shut it down, but Drek captures him. While being dragged away, Ratchet discovers that Qwark has been secretly feeding information to Drek and that he and Nefarious anticipated the attack. Drek then seals Ratchet in an escape pod and ejects him into space as the Rangers witness the destruction of Novalis.<br><br>For several weeks, the Rangers, demoralized by Qwark's betrayal, refuse to move against Drek. Ridden with guilt, Ratchet returns to Veldin and decides to quit. Clank urges him to reconsider, having identified Drek's final target: planet Umbris. Clank reveals that Umbris' destruction will destroy countless other worlds due to a rare orbital convergence; Ratchet deduces that Nefarious planned this from the beginning. Angered by his defeat at the hands of the Rangers, Nefarious has been manipulating Drek, intending to wipe out the entire galaxy. With his confidence restored, Ratchet rejoins the Rangers and heads to planet Kalebo III, where he obtains a Holo-Guise after winning a race championship. Using the Holo-Guise, Ratchet impersonates Qwark and infiltrates the Deplanetizer. He and Clank plan to remove the gravity stabilizer used to hold the Deplanetizer over its target, so that the Rangers can use high-powered magnets to drag it away from Umbris and prevent the planet's destruction.<br><br>An increasingly disillusioned Qwark confronts Drek for breaking his promise to spare the Rangers. Nefarious arrives and mocks Qwark for his treason before sending him away, and betrays Drek by turning him into a sheep and ejecting him into space. Meanwhile, Ratchet successfully removes the gravity stabilizer and defeats Qwark in a one-on-one battle. Realizing the error of his ways, Qwark names Ratchet as the new commander of the Rangers. Before they can arrest Nefarious, the doctor shoots at them and attempts to fire the Deplanetizer. The Rangers deploy the magnets and drag the Deplanetizer sideways, causing him to miss. Enraged, Nefarious, now piloting his personal battle mech, flies to a nearby dwarf star with the intention of triggering a supernova that will end all life in the galaxy. Ratchet destroys the mech and knocks it into the star, resulting in Nefarious' death. With the Deplanetizer disintegrating from the heat of Umbris' atmosphere, Ratchet, Clank, and Qwark use a teleporter to escape just in time.<br><br>In the present, Qwark and Helix are picking trash near the Hall of Heroes. Qwark, looking at a statue of himself, is greeted by Ratchet and Clank. Seizing the opportunity, Helix steals a gun, destroys several patrol bots, hijacks Ratchet's ship, and escapes. As the duo prepare to go after him, Ratchet asks Qwark if he would like to come along, which he gladly accepts.</div>
