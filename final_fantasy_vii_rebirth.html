                <h1>Final Fantasy Vii Rebirth</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth continues the overarching narrative first introduced in Final Fantasy VII Remake (2020), which reimagines the plot, world, and cast of the original Final Fantasy VII (1997). The game takes place on "The Planet" and centers on the journey of the main characters as they seek to end the tyranny of the Shinra Electric Power Company, which controls the megalopolis of Midgar by weaponizing the Lifestream, and defeat Sephiroth (Tyler Hoechlin/Toshiyuki Morikawa), a legendary veteran of Shinra's elite SOLDIER unit who was presumed dead and seeks to summon Meteor to wound the Planet, enabling him to attain godhood by uniting with the Lifestream. Rebirth spans the events from leaving Midgar to the Forgotten Capital; however, the order in which locations are explored is changed from the original game. For example, the visit to Wutai will be saved for the third installment.<br><br>The protagonist and leader of the party is Cloud Strife (Cody Christian/Takahiro Sakurai), a former member of SOLDIER's 1st Class who now works as a mercenary assisting the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE, which opposes Shinra's exploitation of the Planet and its resources. Accompanying him are two of its members: Barret Wallace (John Eric Bentley/Masato Funaki), its brazen but empathetic leader, and Tifa Lockhart (Britt Baron/Ayumi Ito), Cloud's compassionate but shy childhood friend who works as a bartender at the 7th Heaven in Midgar and is a practicing martial artist. They are joined by Aerith Gainsborough (Briana White/Maaya Sakamoto), a flower merchant who previously lived in Midgar's Sector 5 Slums and is the sole survivor of the ancient Cetra; Red XIII (Max Mittelman/Kappei Yamaguchi), an intelligent quadruped from Cosmo Canyon who Shinra held captive as a lab rat; and Yuffie Kisaragi (Suzie Yeung/Yumi Kakazu), an expert Materia thief and ninja from Wutai who resolves to join the team to realize Shinra's downfall after losing her partner Sonon Kusakabe in a failed attempt to extract the "Ultimate Materia" from their headquarters. Supporting characters play roles throughout the story, including Zack Fair (Caleb Pierce/Kenichi Suzumura), Aerith's former boyfriend and the previous wielder of the Buster Sword, who escaped with Cloud after Shinra experimented on them using the cells of the extraterrestrial life-form JENOVA; Cait Sith (Paul Tinto/Hideo Ishikawa), a robotic cat remotely controlled by Shinra's Head of Urban Development Reeve Tuesti (Jon Root/Banjō Ginga); Vincent Valentine (Matthew Mercer/Shōgo Suzuki), a former member of the Turks who Professor Hojo (James Sie/Shigeru Chiba) experimented on; and Cid Highwind (J. Michael Tatum/Kazuhiro Yamaji), a grizzled pilot from Rocket Town and an ex-Shinra rocket scientist who is dedicated to achieving spaceflight. Other characters include Bugenhagen (Frank Todaro/Yōhei Tadano), the elder of Cosmo Canyon; AVALANCHE member Biggs (Gideon Emery/Shūhei Sakaguchi), who, unlike in the original game, survives the Sector 7 Plate's collapse in Midgar and now seeks revenge against Shinra for the deaths of his friends; Dyne (Dave B. Mitchell/Kenjiro Tsuda), a childhood friend of Barret from Mt. Corel and the biological father of his adopted daughter Marlene; and Elena (Piper Reese/Megumi Toyoguchi), a new recruit of the Turks who seeks to apprehend Cloud and his allies.</div>
