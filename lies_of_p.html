                <h1>Lies Of P</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">P awakens in an abandoned train at the Krat Central Station and hears the voice of a woman named Sophia asking him to come to a local hotel. There, Sophia instructs him to find Geppetto. P soon finds Geppetto and rescues him from a mercenary of the group known as the Stalkers. Geppetto asks P to find the inventor Lorenzini Venigni, with whom he once collaborated on the production of puppets. P rescues Lorenzini from his factory and goes to the cathedral, where refugees were hiding. On his way to and inside the cathedral, P fights Carcasses—citizens disfigured by the Petrification Disease who mutated in an unknown way. Sophia asks P to explore the Malum district, where the refugees are likely to have gone. In Malum, P again encounters Carcasses and discovers that the area is controlled by the Black Rabbit Brotherhood. With the help of two Stalkers, the Red Fox and Black Cat, P defeats one of the Brotherhood members. The other three bandits flee, promising revenge. At their base, P finds evidence of the Brotherhood's collaboration with alchemists.<br><br>Geppetto, suspecting the King of Puppets of causing the Puppet Frenzy, sends P to the opera house, the King's lair. After the King's defeat, another puppet emerges from its shell: Romeo, who also suffered from the Petrification Disease and acquired a new appearance after Geppetto's experiments. Trying to speak to P in a language he doesn't understand, they fight, and P ultimately kills Romeo. Geppetto, having met P near the opera house, sends him to the Great Exhibition, where, according to rumors, alchemists have invented a cure for the Petrification Disease. At the exhibition, P meets Simon Manus, the leader of the alchemists. Simon tells him that exposure to Ergo caused the disease and that the mutations, which he considers the next stage of human evolution, are a result of the alchemists' experiments with this mineral. Simon also explains that Ergo is the crystallized form of the human soul that forms after death, and invites P to the Isle of Alchemists.<br><br>To reach the Isle, P needs a Golden Ergo crystal, located in the Barren Swamp, to power Lorenzini's submarine. After obtaining the crystal, P receives a message from Sophia about an attack on the hotel. He returns to discover that the attack was carried out by the Brotherhood and the Red Fox and Black Cat, and that Geppetto has been kidnapped. Meanwhile, Lorenzini deciphers Romeo's message, which reveals that Geppetto, as the puppets' creator, initiated the Puppet Frenzy and has always controlled them. P heads to the submarine but is ambushed by the Brotherhood. He defeats them and departs for the Isle. On the shore, he encounters Sophia, who confesses to being a projection. Her real body, disfigured by Ergo, lies in the Isle tower after Simon exploited Sophia's ability to control Ergo, connecting her to a machine that spreads the Petrification Disease. Sophia reveals that she revived P so he could end her suffering.<br><br>After defeating Laxasia, Simon's henchman, P enters the tower. He finds the real Sophia and faces a choice: leave her alive or end her suffering. Later, P encounters the Red Fox and Black Cat, who either let him pass in exchange for Gold Coin Fruit ventually, P frees Geppetto, who tells him that Simon has gathered enough Ergo to activate a powerful relic called the Arm of God and achieve divine power. P climbs to the top of the tower and fights the mutated Simon. Victorious, P returns to Geppetto, who asks him to give him his mechanical heart to turn P into a real human.<br><br>In the post-credits scene, Paracelsus, disguised as the merchant Giangio, reports the results of the "Krat experiment" to the woman on the phone, calling P "a new type of humanity." The woman points out that eternal life can take many forms, and they agree to continue their observations. Paracelsus expresses his intention to find another "key"—Dorothy. Back in Krat, a girl wearing ruby slippers appears on the rooftops and clicks her heels three times.<br><br>Lies of P takes place in the fictional city of Krat, where alchemists discovered Ergo, a mineral that powered advanced puppets created by Giuseppe Geppetto. Bound by the Grand Covenant to never harm humans, these puppets integrated into many aspects of life, transforming Krat into a thriving city. Soon thereafter, the Petrification Disease swept through the city, slowly blinding its inhabitants, turning them to stone, and ultimately leading to their deaths. As Krat crumbled, the puppets succumbed to a sudden phenomenon known as the Puppet Frenzy, which drove them to madness and led to a massacre of the city's population. Geppetto disappeared, leaving behind a puppet named P.</div>
