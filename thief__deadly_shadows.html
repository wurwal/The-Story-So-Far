                <h1>Thief  Deadly Shadows</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">The game begins when Garrett steals a rare opal from a nobleman's castle. After fencing it, he is contacted by Keeper Artemus, who offers Garrett access to the Keeper Prophecies if he brings to the Keepers two Artifacts: The Builder's Chalice and the Jacknall's Paw, which is kept by the Hammerites and the Pagans, respectively. After learning of a coming "Dark Age", Garrett steals an ancient book, the Compendium of Reproach, that details more about the event, along with a third Artifact called the Kurshok Crown. The Keepers read the Compendium's prophecy, which mentions that an "evil one" will be revealed when time ceases to exist. Garrett suspects that the prophecy might refer to the city's clocktower, rather than time itself, and sabotages the clock, inadvertently causing the tower to collapse.<br><br>Caduca, the Keepers' Interpreter of the Prophecies, is found murdered. Keeper Orland blames Garrett, and fixes a trial where Garrett is found guilty. Garrett escapes, causing Orland to send the Keeper Enforcers, an elite unit of assassins, after Garrett. Garrett eludes them and is contacted by a group of sympathetic Keepers, who mention that the clocktower's rubble formed an arrow which points towards the Keeper Library at their compound. With Orland planning to promote a young girl named Gamall to replace Caduca, and believing Orland's betrayal is foretold in Keeper prophecy, Garrett journeys to the library for evidence. He encounters a mysterious old woman, who uses Glyph magic in an attempt to kill Garrett, but he escapes. Garrett visits Inspector Drept of the Hammerites for answers, and Drept identifies the woman as the Hag, a monstrous folklore creature. Drept advises Garrett to search the abandoned Shalebridge Cradle, having seen the Hag there as a child. The Cradle had formerly been an orphanage and an insane asylum, but has long been abandoned after a fire which killed its inhabitants.<br><br>At the Cradle, Garrett finds a spirit named Lauryl, who resembles Gamall in appearance. Lauryl beckons Garrett to help her trapped spirit leave the Cradle by removing traces of her from it. While successful, Garrett finds he is not able to leave the Cradle, as it remembers him. Garrett enters the past and tricks the Cradle into thinking that he had committed suicide by jumping out of a window. Lauryl leads Garrett to her tomb, which is covered in Glyphs left by Gamall. It is revealed Gamall killed Lauryl and obtained her appearance through the Glyphs for the purpose of becoming Interpreter in order to harness Glyphs and destroy the Keepers. Garrett removes the Glyphs on the tomb with Lauryl's blood, and Gamall, about to become Interpreter in a ceremony, is revealed as a monster. She attacks the Keepers and flees.<br><br>Gamall finds the Final Glyph, which is capable of annulling all glyph magic, and steals the Chalice and the Paw from the Keepers. Finding Gamall's underground lair, Garrett retrieves the Chalice and the Paw. He discovers that the five Keeper Artifacts must be placed in specific locations around the City to activate the Final Glyph, which Gamall intends to destroy. Garrett goes to the Wieldstrom Museum and steals the remaining Artifacts. Outside, Artemus instructs Garrett to hand over the Artifacts, but is revealed to be Gamall in disguise, who kills Orland. Garrett positions the Artifacts to activate the Final Glyph, causing all Glyph magic to end, while Gamall becomes a powerless old woman. In the final scene, Garrett catches a young girl attempting to pickpocket him, and repeats the words spoken by Artemus to Garrett as a young boy.[a]</div>
