                <h1>Stellar Blade</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">The Colony sends the 7th Airborne Squad in its latest attempt to liberate Earth from the Naytiba. However, the invasion ends in disaster with Eve being the sole survivor of the landing force, and with her close friend Tachy sacrificing herself to protect her from an unidentified Alpha Naytiba. She is saved by Adam, a scavenger who enlists her aid in recovering a Hyper Cell power source from the ruined megacity of Eidos 7. In return, Adam leads Eve to a nearby Alpha Naytiba for her to slay. After eliminating the Alpha Naytiba, Eve comes across a survivor of the 5th Airborne Squad, Lily, who decides to join Eve as her engineering support. Adam then takes both of them to Xion, the last human city on Earth, and requests their aid in saving Xion. Eve then meets Xion's leader Orcal, who explains that in addition to the Hyper Cell she recovered from Eidos 7, three more Hyper Cells will be needed to restore Xion to its full functionality. Not only will this allow him to revive the tens of thousands of humans kept in stasis within the city, but also to locate other Alpha Naytibas. Orcal further explains that four Alpha Naytiba Cores will be needed to form a Master Core, which will allow access into the Naytibas' Nest where their leader, the Elder Naytiba, resides.<br><br>After recovering the second Hyper Cell, Orcal informs Eve about the location of the second Alpha Core, and becomes devastated upon learning that Tachy was transformed into an Alpha Naytiba, forcing her to kill her and retrieve her core. Once the third Hyper Cell is recovered, the team recovers a recording from a previous Airborne Squad member named Raven who alleges that what they currently believe is humanity is actually a race of advanced human-like androids called Andro-Eidos and that the Naytibas are actually the original human race after they resorted to radical genetic modification. Orcal confirms that long ago their leader, the AI Mother Sphere, created the Andro-Eidos at humanity's behest and both races lived in peace. However, Mother Sphere suddenly ordered the Andro-Eidos to exterminate humanity and rewrote history to fool the Andro-Eidos into believing they are humans. Meanwhile, the surviving humans went into hiding and eventually transformed themselves into the Naytibas as a way to fight back against Mother Sphere and the Andro-Eidos. Despite being shocked at the revelation that she has been killing the descendants of humanity, Eve is still determined to end the war by killing the Elder Naytiba.<br><br>Eve learns from Orcal that the third Alpha core is located atop a space elevator, but before breaking in, Adam receives concerning word from Xion and leaves both Lily and Eve. After defeating the Alpha Naytiba Demogorgon, Eve fails to retrieve its Alpha core and is saved by Lily, who relays a signal to the Colony to send the powered exoskeleton Providence to assist her back to Earth. They return to Xion and discover it under attack by the Naytiba. Eve and Lily rush back to the city to defend it, and Eve confronts the same unidentified Alpha Naytiba who attacked her and killed Tachy. After defeating it and retrieving its core, she is shocked to see its true identity as Raven. Raven manages to retreat while Eve attends to Orcal. Orcal admits that he is also an Alpha Naytiba himself, being a fusion of Andro-Eidos and Naytiba technology. With Eve only having three Alpha Cores in her possession, Orcal sacrifices himself by using his own Alpha Core to create the Master Core. He then pleads for Eve to meet the Elder Naytiba before passing away. Eve and Lily head for the Nest, and on the way find a final recording by Raven, who reveals she had grown disillusioned upon discovering that Mother Sphere not only exterminated the original humans but also ruined Earth's surface by jettisoning large parts of the Colony from orbit to prevent the Naytiba from completely overrunning it.<br><br>Upon reaching the entrance of the Nest, Eve encounters Raven who tries to stop her from entering, but Eve is able to defeat her and leaves her disabled but alive. Eve and Lily then enter the nest, only to discover Adam's true identity as Raphael Marks, the scientist who created the Mother Sphere, and the Elder Naytiba who created the Naytibas, throwing the world into conflict with Andro-Eidos and Humanity wars. Adam explains that he has come to regret creating the Naytiba, as that meant the sacrifice of their humanity. He also realizes that as androids that lack human DNA, Andro-Eidos cannot be the true successors of humanity due to their inability to evolve. To address this, Adam offers to fuse himself with Eve to become the next step in human evolution, which will both eliminate the threat of the Naytiba and give humanity a chance at a new future. The ending diverges based on Eve's choices and previous actions.<br><br>- If Eve refuses to accept Adam's plan, the two are forced to battle each other with Eve ultimately prevailing. Adam dies along with the last hope for humanity, and Mother Sphere welcomes Eve and Lily back to the Colony now that their mission is complete.<br><br><br>- If Eve accepts Adam's plan, the two of them fuse to create an entirely new type of human being. Mother Sphere then overrides Lily's power armor and has it attack Eve, forcing her to defend herself. Eve prevails, with Lily surviving or dying depending on whether Eve has maximum affection with her or not.<br><br><br>- If Eve hasn't reached maximum affection with Lily, Lily will die. Mother Sphere then arrives and congratulates Eve for eliminating the Elder Naytiba as planned. However, with no further use for her, Mother Sphere sends an army to destroy Eve, and the game ends with her fighting against an endless horde of Andro-Eidos soldiers.<br><br><br>- If Lily's relationship has reached maximum and the Iberis code has been recovered from Lily's Atelier in Eidos 9, Lily hacks the robot with the Iberis code and ejects herself to safety. Eve manages to completely annihilate the army Mother Sphere sends at her. Lily then delivers the fourth and final Hyper Cell to Xion, fully restoring the city while Eve becomes its new protector.</div>
