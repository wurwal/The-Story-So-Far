                <h1>As Dusk Falls</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In 1998, the Walker family—Vince, his wife Michelle, six-year-old daughter Zoe, and father Jim—are relocating to St. Louis, Missouri. On their way through Two Rock, Arizona they are involved in a car accident with the Holt brothers, Tyler, Dale, and Jay, and their car is left immobile. Unable to proceed, the family rent a room at a nearby motel, the Desert Dream. The Holt brothers arrive at the house of Sheriff Dante Romero, intending to steal the hundreds of thousands of dollars in his safe. The youngest brother, Jay, also takes a book on birds because he likes them. The Sheriff arrives home unexpectedly and the brothers flee, but Romero sees their truck and assigns his entire force to locating it. The brothers arrive to and take shelter in the Desert Dream, taking the Walkers, owner Joyce, and handyman Paul hostage, intending to hide until dusk. Based on choices made, the police are alerted in different ways and surround the Desert Dream.<br><br>Various flashbacks reveal that the Walker marriage is struggling in Sacramento, California. Vince was fired from his job as an aircraft engineer  after a technical fault led to some deaths. Despite having warned the owners of the fault, Vince is under pressure to take the blame in exchange for money. Michelle has also begun an affair, and Jim, long-absent from Vince's life, is suffering from a brain tumor. The Holts are revealed as a dysfunctional family kept in poverty by their gambling addict father Bear. The brothers robbed the Sheriff to pay off his debts and remove the threat to their lives from his debtors. Jay either prevents Bear killing himself for the insurance money or lets him die.<br><br>The Holts' mother Sharon talks her way into the building by convincing the police she will convince the brothers to surrender. Instead she plots with them to escape. Romero makes contact with Vince and encourages him to locate a black book unwittingly stolen by the brothers. Working with Jay, they eventually realize it was inside the bird book he took. The black book details Romero's corrupt dealings including bribes and criminal money, all held in a single offshore account. Romero is adamant that the money belongs to dangerous people and he needs the book back, launching two futile assaults that get several officers shot and killed. Finally ramming a school bus through the front door of the motel, the bus is set on fire and explodes and the surviving Holts flee with a hostage, Vince or Zoe. Dale is shot and killed, and depending on decisions made, Michelle, Joyce, and Vince can also die.</div>
