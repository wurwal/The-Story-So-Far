                <h1>Yakuza 4</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Loan shark Shun Akiyama learns that members of the Ueno Seiwa Clan, a Yakuza faction involved in a power struggle with the Tojo Clan since the early 1980s, are causing a disturbance. Akiyama beats them up as Tojo Clan members Hiroaki Arai and Takeshi Kido arrive. One of the men, Masaru Ihara (Takahiro Fujimoto), shoots at Arai and flees. Akiyama returns to his office only to find that Arai killed Ihara. Arai flees, and Akiyama is brought in for questioning. His secretary, Hana (Aya Hirano), gets him released, but detective Junji Sugiuchi warns Akiyama to avoid the yakuza. Akiyama reveals to Kido that he used money from the Millennium Tower explosion to start his firm, Sky Finance. Later on, a woman named Lily requests a ¥100 million loan. Akiyama learns that people involved with her are being killed, and when he confronts her, she takes the money and flees. Akiyama eventually meets Goro Majima, who reveals that he is looking for Lily.<br><br>In 1985, Majima and his blood brother, Taiga Saejima, prepare to assassinate the chairman of the Ueno Seiwa Clan. Saejima is forced to perform the hit alone, killing eighteen men, though the chairman and one other officer, Isao Katsuragi (Fumihiko Tachiki), survive. Saejima is sentenced to death. In the present, just days before his scheduled execution, Saejima is transferred to a prison off the coast of Okinawa. He meets former Tojo patriarch Goh Hamazaki, imprisoned for attempting to murder Kiryu. He reveals to Saejima that he was set up. They escape, and Hamazaki seemingly sacrifices himself to save Saejima from the prison chief, Saito (Masato Obara). Saejima washes up to shore and meets Kiryu and Haruka. With help from Kiryu, Saejima tracks down and fights Majima, who reveals that he was intercepted on the day of the hit.<br><br>Detective Masayoshi Tanimura investigates Ihara's murder. He finds Lily, who is revealed to be Saejima's sister Yasuko, and rescues her from the Shibata Family. He learns that patriarch Kazuo Shibata (Hōchū Ōtsuka) is working with Arai and organized the 1985 hit with help from Katsuragi. Arai kills Shibata under Katsuragi's orders and flees. Yasuko tells Tanimura that his father was investigating the hit, but was killed. She also tells him that she was coerced into killing Shibata's men by Katsuragi, who promised to have Saejima's case reexamined if she eliminated them or gave him ¥100 million. Tanimura meets Katsuragi and hands him the money. Katsuragi then reveals that he was responsible for the eighteen murders, and orders Tanimura killed. However, Sugiuchi saves him.<br><br>Tanimura's superior, Satoshi Hisai (Hideyuki Tanaka), reveals that Sugiuchi was his father's partner. Tanimura returns the money to Akiyama, and they conclude that Katsuragi is silencing anyone involved with the hit. Yutaka Mishima (Yoshihiro Kanemitsu), Ihara's friend, contacts Tanimura, offering to inform on Katsuragi. Sugiuchi kills Mishima and reveals that he is Katsuragi's mole, and that he killed Tanimura’s father. He reveals that he and Katsuragi covered up the hit with help from Deputy Commissioner Seishiro Munakata. Hisai, who was Munakata's mole, killed Sugiuchi and committed suicide out of guilt.<br><br>Hamazaki, having survived, arrives at Kiryu’s orphanage. He tells Kiryu he wants to reform and reveals a ledger indicating that the police instigated the 10 billion yen incident alongside Kyohei Jingu. He links the scheme to Munakata and Katsuragi, who plan to destroy the Tojo and allow the Ueno Seiwa to take over Kamurocho. When Hamazaki is about to turn himself in, he and Kiryu find Yasuko, and offer to help her. Saito arrives with orders to kill them. Kiryu beats him and goes to Kamurocho with Yasuko; Hamazaki is wounded and later dies.<br><br>Later on, Sky Finance is raided, so Akiyama and Tanimura agree to work together. Kiryu leaves Yasuko with Date, and goes to meet Majima, who is seen being arrested. Munakata tells Daigo Dojima his plan to give the police control of organized crime, and offers to eliminate the Ueno Seiwa if Daigo promotes Arai, who is an undercover police officer.<br><br>Kiryu finds Date drugged by Yasuko, and is forced to track her down. He is confronted by Akiyama and Tanimura, but beats them, and then learns that Yasuko and Saejima have been captured by Katsuragi. Back at Serena, Akiyama tells everyone that Kido, under orders from Katsuragi, stole ¥100 billion yen from him. At Kamurocho Hills, Katsuragi tells Kiryu he’ll return the Saejimas and the money in return for the ledger, but Kido shoots him and gives the ledger to Arai, who shoots him and leaves. Katsuragi and Yasuko kill each other; and Arai shoots Munakata when he orders him to kidnap Haruka and Kiryu's orphans to recover the money.<br><br>Kiryu uses Hamazaki’s and Yasuko’s deaths to motivate Saejima, Tanimura and Akiyama. They use Akiyama's money as bait on the roof of the Millennium Tower. Daigo and Arai arrive to claim it, along with Kido, who reveals he is working for Daigo. Munakata, having faked his death, brings officers to kill the others. Akiyama, Kiryu, Saejima and Tanimura defeat Arai, Daigo, Kido, and Munakata and his men. When Munakata declares that he is untouchable, Date scatters newspapers exposing his corruption. He shoots Akiyama, but a wad of money stops the bullet. Faced with prison, Munakata commits suicide. Arai surrenders to the authorities.<br><br>Months later, the group meets outside Akiyama's office, where he intends to restart his business. Date rejoins the police and asks Kiryu what he intends to do; Kiryu, Daigo, and a newly-freed Majima appoint Saejima as patriarch of his own family at Tojo Clan headquarters.<br><br>Yakuza 4 takes place one year after the events of Yakuza 3. Like the original game, most of the action takes place in Kamurocho (resembling Shinjuku's red-light district, Kabukichō). Three locations have been added since Yakuza 3: a rooftop area stretching across a large portion of the town, the back streets of Kamurocho (known as Rojiura (路地裏)) and a third area known as the underground (or "chika" (地下), which includes the city's sewers, parking lot and shopping arcades). The underground area is also known as Kamuchika (カムチカ), short for Kamuro Chika (Kamuro underground).</div>
