                <h1>Bayonetta (Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Bayonetta, a witch who was awakened twenty years ago from the bottom of a lake, has no memories of her past. Owning one-half of a pair jewels known as the "Eyes of the World," Bayonetta leaves for Vigrid when the informant Enzo informs her of rumors that the other half, the 'Right Eye' is there. She is capable of traversing between Paradiso and Chaos, the realms of angels and humans respectively, but not able to enter Inferno, the realm of demons. While at Vigrid, she encounter various angels from Paradiso who attempted but fail to kill her.<br><br>Bayonetta confronts another Umbra Witch named Jeanne, who seemingly has ties to Bayonetta's past, and a young man named Luka, who blames Bayonetta for his father's death when he discovered her. Eventually, Bayonetta discovers that Jeanne is associated with the angels somehow, and fights her again. Afterwards, she meets a lost child named Cereza, who believes Bayonetta to be her mother and starts following her. Returning to the human world, Bayonetta continues her search for the Right Eye, journeying to an island named Isla del Sol with Luka and Cereza, while gradually remembering her past and uncovering the answers to her questions: she and Jeanne are the only survivors of the Umbra Witches, which was rendered near extinction after a clan war with the Lumen Sage clan, followed a massive witch hunt led by the angels of Paradiso. She also discovered that both halves of the Eyes of the World are artifacts created by Aesir (also known as The Overseer), the God of  the human realm who decided to grant humans free will out of pity, by bestowing the eyes (which contain his power) separately to both Lumen Sages and Umbra Witches. Additionally, Paradiso, Chaos and Inferno were originally a single realm before it was split during an event called First Armageddon.<br><br>Bayonetta is confronted again by Jeanne, who explains Bayonetta was a child born from an Umbra Witch and a Lumen Sage, a forbidden union. Bayonetta defeats Jeanne, who reveals the reason Bayonetta possesses the Left Eye is because she has accepted her fate. Bayonetta hands Jeanne the gem she had been carrying, making her remember she is Cereza, and that Jeanne was once her friend; it was Jeanne who sealed her away during the Witch Hunt, giving Bayonetta the gem to protect her and the Left Eye. After Jeanne seemingly sacrifices herself to save Bayonetta, the latter continues through the tower with Luka and Cereza.<br><br>At the top, Bayonetta meets Balder, the last of the Lumen Sages. Balder reveals he is Bayonetta's father, and plans to reunite the three realms by resurrecting Jubileus the Creator, the ruler of Paradiso. He also reveals that Bayonetta herself is the Left Eye, but for her to awaken it, she had to regain her memories. For that reason, he brought Cereza, who is Bayonetta as a child, from the past, to awaken her memories. Confronted by Luka, he throws him to his death, revealing he was the one behind the death of Luka's father, and further reveals that he had mind-controlled Jeanne to do his bidding. Bayonetta fights and seemingly kills Balder, and saves Luka.<br><br>After returning Cereza to the past, leaving behind her watch and some parting words, Bayonetta returns to the present. However, her actions have caused her to alter the events leading to her sealing 500 years ago, changing the past and awakening the Left Eye, causing her to collapse from the overwhelming power. Balder, who had survived the fight, transports himself and the unconscious Bayonetta towards the statue on top of the tower, beginning the resurrection of Jubileus. As the statue launches into space, Jeanne, who had survived, reappears, free from Balder's control. She ascends the launching statue on her motorcycle; reaching Bayonetta, she saves her, but Jubileus comes alive, consuming Balder. Bayonetta defeats Jubileus by summoning Queen Sheba, who punches the deity's soul into the sun. As Jubileus' physical body plummets towards Earth, Jeanne and Bayonetta destroy it.<br><br>The epilogue, mirroring the start of the game, shows Jeanne and Bayonetta continuing to battle against the angels.<br><br>Bayonetta takes place in Vigrid, a fictional city in Europe. Bayonetta (voiced by Hellena Taylor / Atsuko Tanaka) is a witch who shapeshifts and uses various firearms, along with magical attacks she performs with her hair by summoning demons to dispatch her foes. She awakens after a 500-year sleep and finds herself in an unfamiliar area with no memories of who or what she is. Over time, she begins to remember what caused her current predicament. Five hundred years before the incident that caused Bayonetta's memory loss, there were two factions preserving the balance between darkness and light in the world: the Umbra Witches, who are followers of darkness, and their counterparts, the Lumen Sages, who are followers of light. The factions shared two distinct treasures, the 'Eyes of the World' (separately named the 'Left Eye of Darkness' and the 'Right Eye of Light') which they used to oversee the just passage of time. Both factions mysteriously disappeared from Vigrid under unknown circumstances. Bayonetta has an ornate piece of jewelry which contains a small red gem, and believes this gem is the Left Eye of the World. While searching for the Right Eye, she occasionally receives flashbacks that make her remember what happened.<br><br>Other characters include Luka (ルカ) (voiced by Yuri Lowenthal / Daisuke Namikawa), who met Bayonetta as a child; Bayonetta's rival and fellow Umbra Witch Jeanne (ジャンヌ, Jannu) (voiced by Grey DeLisle / Mie Sonozaki), who wields four guns like Bayonetta; Rodin (ロダン, Rodan) (voiced by Dave Fennoy / Tesshō Genda), the owner of a bar called the Gates Of Hell where Bayonetta can buy various weapons and items; an informant named Enzo (エンツォ, Entso) (voiced by Chick Vennera / Wataru Takagi) who looks and sounds similar to actor Joe Pesci and provides comic relief; a young girl named Cereza (セレッサ, Seressa) (voiced by Joy Jillian / Miyuki Sawashiro) whom Bayonetta meets early in the game; and the main antagonist Balder (バルドル, Barudoru) (voiced by Grant Albrecht / Norio Wakamoto).<br><br>The game settings borrow from Dante's Divine Comedy: Paradiso (heaven), which generally takes the form of a heavenly yellow or golden valley or palace and is the home of the "Angel" enemies she faces; Purgatorio (purgatory), a metarealm that functions as an "in between" for metaphysical beings and stands alongside yet outside of the plane humans exist on (all beings in and outside of Purgatorio take on a transparent, watery appearance); Inferno (hell), which is not visited in the game, but contains the infernal demons that Bayonetta summons in combat, using her hair as a conduit.</div>
