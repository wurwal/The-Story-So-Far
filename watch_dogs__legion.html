                <h1>Watch Dogs  Legion</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">The London branch of DedSec, led by Sabine Brandt and her newly crafted AI, Bagley, detect armed intruders planting explosives in the Houses of Parliament. DedSec operative Dalton Wolfe goes to defuse the bombs and discovers the intruders are members of a rogue hacker group called "Zero Day". Although Dalton manages to prevent Parliament's destruction, he is gunned down by drones commanded by Zero Day's leader, who detonates additional explosives around London and orders an attack on DedSec's main hideout, forcing Sabine to shut down Bagley and go into hiding. In the wake of the bombings, the British government contract Albion with restoring order to London and hunting down DedSec, who are held responsible for the chaos, effectively causing social and political unrest.<br><br>Months later, Albion enforces the law without political oversight, transforming London into a surveillance state with the aid of its ctOS network and SIRS, a conglomerate of Britain's intelligence agencies. As a result, citizens have their personal liberties severely restricted and their lives constantly monitored, while those who question Albion's methods are either convicted or deported to Continental Europe. Organised crime is also on the rise, despite Albion's presence. Although most DedSec members have been arrested or killed by Albion, Sabine resurfaces when she finds a new recruit through ctOS, who is sent to reactivate the group's safehouse and Bagley. DedSec slowly rebuild their strength as they find more recruits who, under Sabine's co-ordination and with Bagley's help, liberate London's boroughs by encouraging citizens to rise up in defiance of their oppressors.<br><br>During this time, DedSec investigate the bombings and discover that both Albion's CEO Nigel Cass and Clan Kelley, London's biggest crime syndicate, were involved, and are taking advantage of London's current situation for their own ends: Clan Kelley is using people from Albion's deportation centers for their trafficking operations, while Cass plans to enforce peace across London with 'Project THEMIS', an oppressive army of combat drones that can identify and neutralize threats before they occur. After their investigation reaches a dead end, DedSec decide to follow other leads, such as technology company Broca Tech, whose CEO Skye Larsen has been conducting inhumane experiments to convert human minds into AI programs; and Richard Malik, a SIRS whistleblower who enlists DedSec's help in proving SIRS leader Emma Child was behind the Zero Day bombings, only to later be revealed that he was trying to take over SIRS, which he accomplishes after killing Child in an explosion that DedSec are framed for.<br><br>DedSec eventually deal with both Larsen and Malik, before infiltrating a slave auction hosted by Clan Kelley's leader, Mary Kelley, where they discover Kelley helped Zero Day smuggle their explosives into the country. After gathering enough evidence to get Kelley convicted, DedSec and Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) Detective Kaitlyn Lau attempt to capture her, but after realizing that Kelley will walk free regardless, they leave her to be killed by her former slaves. DedSec next sabotage Cass's drone project and expose his crimes to the public, prompting him to take refuge at Albion's headquarters in the Tower of London. Fearing Cass will attempt to retaliate against his enemies, DedSec storm the Tower and kill Cass.<br><br>As DedSec celebrate their successes, Zero Day hacks the group, stealing the tech they had acquired. Tracing the hack, they discover that Sabine was behind the bombings and Zero Day, and that Cass helped her until double-crossing her for control of data gathering technology. In response, Sabine restarted DedSec simply to get revenge on Cass, recover what he had stolen, and seek out other components. DedSec discover Sabine intends to use the stolen technology to create a patch for Bagley and take control of Britain's ctOS infrastructure, plunging the country into chaos in hopes it will force society to forgo technology and restart. To prevent this, Bagley agrees to be shut down. Avoiding the chaos caused by Sabine, a DedSec operative goes to hack Blume's radio tower, to prevent the patch from being spread. Sabine confronts them, but the operative lowers the tower's fins and sends her falling to her apparent death. Meanwhile, another operative shuts down Bagley's primary server at Broca Tech, ending the crisis.<br><br>While the British government reviews its contract with Albion and the MPS begins work to resume operations, DedSec finally clear their names and are praised for exposing considerable crimes and corruption across London. In an epilogue scene, they manage to restore Bagley to his original state, and continue to rely on him to help them finish off loose ends around London.<br><br>Watch Dogs: Legion takes place within a fictionalised representation of London in the "near future" (suggested to be the year 2029 or 2030 by the Bloodline expansion). The setting encompasses notable landmarks, boroughs, and cultural styles of the city, such as the Palace of Westminster, Big Ben, the London Eye, Buckingham Palace, The Shard and more. Since the events of Watch Dogs 2, technology has undergone a rapid acceleration as a result of the proliferation of automation and artificial intelligence (AI), which has effectively improved Britain's economy at the cost of many blue and white collar jobs. The use of cryptocurrency has also become abundant, with an unofficial currency by the name of 'ETO' having almost replaced the pound sterling entirely within London. AR and VR systems are commonplace across the city, accompanied by an increase in drones and electric cars, an established 6G mobile network, and the introduction of self-driving cars much of which is enhanced through the use of ctOS (central Operating System)â”€the centralized computer network developed by technology company Blume, featured in Watch Dogs and Watch Dogs 2.<br><br>The game focuses on DedSec, a hacker group consisting of various branches across the world, who fight against authority regimes and groups that utilise ctOS for their own selfish goals at the expense of ordinary citizens. Their main enemies include Zero Day, a rogue hacker group that frames DedSec for a series of terrorist bombings; Albion, a private military company that takes over as law enforcement across London and supersedes the British government's control over the city; Clan Kelley, an East End criminal syndicate that has monopolised the use of the dark web, conducting human and organ trafficking operations; Broca Tech, a corrupt biotechnology corporation; and Signals Intelligence Response (SIRS), an intelligence agency formed from the consolidation of Britain's intelligence network.</div>
