                <h1>Lifeless Planet</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">An astronaut travels to another planet that is thought to be filled with lifeforms. The mission is a failure as the ship is lost in the crash, both of the other crew members are killed, and the planet turns out to be an enormous wasteland seemingly completely devoid of life; however, among the vast emptiness is a derelict Soviet Union science outpost constructed on the planet. The game follows the protagonist as he explores the planet, figures out how the Soviets managed to travel to the planet and why the outpost is now empty, and why the planet is devoid of life. As he explores through the planet, he occasionally receives hallucinations and flashbacks of his life on Earth. As the protagonist makes his way across the planet in search of answers, he finds out he is not alone and the only other survivor is a mysterious Russian woman named Aelita who guides him through the planet's eerie landscape.<br><br>Through audio recordings left behind by the Soviet colonists, the protagonist is able to piece together what occurred on the planet. In 1974, the Soviets discovered a portal in Siberia which led them to the planet. The planet was originally filled with bountiful lifeforms, among them a strange type of green moss that acted as the primary energy source for the planet's native lifeforms (which the Soviets adapted as their main source of electricity on the planet). Wanting to use the planet to establish a "new Motherland" for their people, the Soviets kept their discovery a secret as they began colonizing the planet. The entrance portal was eventually discovered to be only one way, constructed in this manner by the planet's previous inhabitants due to the times between the planet and Earth being out of sync (Earth is hundreds of years ahead of the planet). To compensate, the previous inhabitants had constructed a second "exit" portal that led back to Earth, which was discovered by the Soviet colonists and used with the entrance portal to receive resources and new colonists.<br><br>However, the Soviets' overuse of the portals and the planet's resources caused the green moss to gradually die out, which led to the portal mutating the remaining lifeforms on the planet to become hostile towards the colonists. The portals themselves also became extremely unstable, and their connection to Earth was eventually severed. While looking for a solution, the Soviet scientists discovered that Aelita, a colonist who had lost both of her children early on in the crisis, had been maintaining a secret garden containing the various plant forms of the planet, among them the now extinct green moss. After observing that Aelita could interact with the plant forms, the desperate scientists experimented on her, injecting her with DNA taken from the plants of the planet. As a result, Aelita transformed into a human-plant hybrid that was able to survive on the planet and influence the growth of its plants. Unfortunately, this was insufficient to prevent the colonists' demise, and all of them were eventually wiped out, leaving Aelita the sole survivor.<br><br>After discovering this information, the protagonist is led by Aelita to the heart of the planet, where she sacrifices herself to restore the planet's original life forms. This also has the consequence of repairing the previously unstable portals, allowing the protagonist to leave the planet. As the protagonist makes his way to the exit portal, an interview flashback reveals that he had a wife on Earth. One day, she disappeared, later discovered to have fallen off of a cliff and rendered comatose, with a mysterious green moss growing around her toes by the time she was found by the protagonist. Afterward, she was placed under life support, which served as the reason for the protagonist volunteering to participate in the one-way expedition to the planet in the first place: despite knowing that it would take a long time (if at all) for his wife to recover, he was still unwilling to take her off of life support, as he wanted to give her "every chance to live again, even if [he] wasn't there". Reaching the portal, the protagonist returns to Earth, now hundreds of years into the future. Reflecting on his experiences, the protagonist arrives on a cliff (the same one of which his wife fell off) that overlooks a futuristic city.</div>
