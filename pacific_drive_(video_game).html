                <h1>Pacific Drive (Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In Washington's Olympic Peninsula in 1947, American researcher Dr. Ophelia "Oppy" Turner, her husband Allen, and her colleagues including scientists Tobias Barlow and Francis Cooke, develop "LIM technology", a revolutionary experimental technology, with the cooperation of the United States government. However, LIM technology experimentation leads to mysterious phenomena and unexplained disappearances in the region, which in 1955 prompts the creation of the U.S. Advanced Resonance Development Agency (ARDA). ARDA establishes the Olympic Exclusion Zone to secretly research the phenomena, referred to as "anomalies", while Oppy and her long-triumphed LIM technology fade from the public interest. Initially consisting of approximately western Clallam County near Forks, the spread of anomalies and the worsening instability of the original Zone leads to its expansion in 1961 and 1967 to eventually cover 3,600 square miles (9,300Â km2), almost the entire Peninsula, before being completely evacuated and sealed in 1987 after ARDA's disestablishment.<br><br>In 1998, the player, referred to as "the Driver", drives to the Zone's wall, but a roadblock forces them to take a detour through a forest, where a bright light suddenly teleports them into the Outer Zone (the 1967 Zone boundary) and destroys their van. Stumbling through the undergrowth, the Driver finds a still-operational station wagon and is contacted through its radio by Tobias and Francis, who direct the Driver to a garage owned by Oppy, who reluctantly agrees to assist the Driver and let them use the garage. Oppy, Tobias, and Francis explain the nature of anomalies, including one called a "Remnant", which inhabits inanimate objects and forms a psychic link with the host, gradually causing the host to become obsessed with the object to the point of insanity; they deduce the station wagon is a Remnant and agree to help the Driver separate from it and escape the Zone.<br><br>Oppy gives the Driver an invention called an ARC device, which can teleport them to the garage in an emergency, and suggests they take the station wagon to a massive anomaly known as "Colossal Cappy" to confirm if it is a Remnant by driving into it, a gambit which succeeds and confirms the station wagon is indeed a Remnant. Francis reveals the interaction between Cappy and the Remnant caused an event called the "Mass Hallucination", and that the signal from the event was equal and opposite to the Remnant and originated in the Deep Zone (the original 1955 Zone boundary), which they believe could cancel out the Remnant. Tobias and Francis have the Driver seek out three anomalies in the Mid Zone (the 1961 Zone boundary) known as "the Murals" to locate the Mass Hallucination source, while Oppy suggests the Driver explore the research facility where her husband Allen died in an experiment that caused the previous Mass Hallucination 40 years prior. The group eventually locates the source within the Deep Zone, but with its disabled power grid making access impossible, they devise a plan to jump start the grid using the station wagon and their own battery supplies; however, when a power surge damages the batteries, Tobias sacrifices himself to complete the plan and get the Driver into the Deep Zone.<br><br>In the Deep Zone, Oppy manages to supercharge the ARC device so it can work there. The Driver soon locates and enters the source, known as the Well, and is transported into a bizarre maze of television screens where they overhear past conversations between Oppy, Allen, Francis, and Tobias, as well as a deceased Tobias who leaves a final farewell to Francis and a parting message for Oppy from Allen. The Driver recovers the station wagon in the Well and returns to the garage, where Oppy and Francis reveal they heard everything there and that the Remnant is gone, though the station wagon is still linked to the Driver. After congratulating Francis on his theories (which she had previously dismissed) being correct, Oppy passes on her research and equipment to Francis and the Driver and finally leaves the Zone.</div>
