                <h1>Fire Emblem Awakening</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated animate__slower">After dreaming of killing Chrom, an amnesiac Robin awakens in a field, where Chrom and members of his personal army, the Shepherds, find and take him/her in. The Avatar joins the Shepherds after exhibiting the qualities of a tactician when they defend a nearby town from Plegian bandits. After gaining an alliance with Regna Ferox, the Shepherds move to fight Plegia's forces and revenant monsters called the Risen, and are aided by a masked man calling himself "Marth". After a confrontation between Plegia and the Shepherds, Validar and his minions almost kill Emmeryn. However, the assassination plot is foiled with aid from "Marth", who has prior knowledge of the event and is revealed to be a woman. Soon after, Plegian forces capture Emmeryn as she goes to parley with King Gangrel, Plegia's ruler, with Gangrel demanding the Fire Emblem in exchange for her life. Though Chrom almost accepts Gangrel's terms, Emmeryn stops him by throwing herself over a cliff, becoming a martyr to both Ylisse and Plegia. Eventually, the Shepherds triumph over Plegia, defeating Gangrel and restoring peace to the continent.<br><br>Two years after Gangrel's defeat, Chrom inherits the throne of Ylisse, marries, and fathers a newborn daughter named Lucina. He leads the Shepherds again when Emperor Walhart of Valm threatens to invade Ylisse, and during the campaign "Marth" returns and reveals to Chrom that she is actually Lucina. She hails from an alternate timeline in a future where Grima has been resurrected, and she used a time traveling spell that Naga devised to return to the past and prevent the events leading to her future. To combat Grima, Chrom must perform the "Awakening", a ritual that grants him Naga's power, by combining the Fire Emblem with five magical gems divided among the nations. During and after the war in Valm, the Shepherds manage to retrieve four of the gemstones, but Validar, the new king of Plegia and Robin's father, ambushes them after offering them the last gemstone. Validar takes control of Robin and steals the Fire Emblem from Chrom, and reveals that Robin was born as the ideal vessel for Grima. Lucina realizes that Grima used Robin to kill Chrom in her timeline, and attempts to execute him/her. Chrom forces her to stand down, remaining confident that Robin can overcome Grima's control; alternatively, if Robin is Lucina's husband or mother, Lucina is unable to go through with it and stands down on her own. The Shepherds manage to track down Validar, who uses Robin to attack Chrom, mirroring the events of the "invisible Ties" premonition. However, Robin uses his/her foreknowledge to prevent Chrom's death, allowing the Shepherds to kill Validar and recover the Fire Emblem.<br><br>A possessed Robin from Lucina's future appears, revealing that the present timeline Robin's amnesia was caused by Grima's unsuccessful attempt to possess him/her. The future Robin then uses the power gathered for Grima's resurrection to restore his dragon form. Chrom performs the Awakening and summons Naga, who reveals that although he now has the power to stop Grima, she only has enough power to put him to sleep for another thousand years. She tells him that the only way to truly destroy Grima is to have Robin kill him, which would result in Robin's death as well.She adds that Robin may survive if his/her bond with Chrom and the Shepherds is strong enough. In the final battle, the Shepherds manage to weaken Grima and Chrom, who is opposed to the Avatar's sacrifice, offers to deliver the final blow. Depending on the player's final choice, the game will reach one of two different endings. If Chrom deals the final blow, Grima is put back to sleep for another thousand years, though the Avatar is left with regrets. If Robin deals the final blow, both him/her and Grima die. Despite this, Chrom and the Shepherds refuse to believe that Robin is dead, and vow to find him/her and bringhim/her home. In a post-credits scene, Robin awakens in a field similar to the beginning of the game, where Chrom and Lissa find him/her and welcome him/her home.</div>
