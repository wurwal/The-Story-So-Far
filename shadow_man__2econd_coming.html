                <h1>Shadow Man  2Econd Coming</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">The game starts off as New York cop Thomas Deacon and his partner Gabe fight a huge demonic creature named Sammael in an abandoned building. Their goal is to steal an enormous ancient book, because it couldn't be allowed to fall into the hands of evil. Thomas  successfully grabs the codex and escapes the building but Gabe is horrifically shredded to pieces by Sammael's claws.<br><br>Some ten years later a near-empty passenger train is headed to New Orleans. Sitting alone is Michael LeRoi, who is waiting for night to fall, because then Michael will turn into The Shadowman. Nettie was waiting for Michael at her church but she felt that something was wrong. Nettie looked at the sky, where she saw a blazing star and she knew that it meant trouble. Simultaneously in a run down N.Y. tenement building a legless Thomas Deacon, who lost his legs fleeing the demon & taking the codex with him, rolled over to the window in his wheelchair and noticed the gigantic star. Michael had already looked out the dusty train window and noticed the unfamiliar sky. He had to ask Nettie, because the whole world might be in trouble.<br><br>Michael wasted no time upon his arrival in New Orleans & went straight to the Wild at Heart bar which was run by Jaunty, the closest person Michael had to a "friend". The bar was deserted and dead quiet which was severely out of place. Michael couldn't find Jaunty but once he went upstairs into the loft, he found everything ransacked, a dead body and bloody arcane symbols drawn on the walls. Michael knew it was some sort of gang but he didn’t recognize it.<br><br>After meeting up with Nettie in the church they both plan to search the Louisiana swampland for Jaunty. Michael still needed to find his gun and his dad's pocket watch but Jaunty was first priority. The mysterious gang had kidnapped Jaunty and hung him in a tree, with the same arcane symbols from the bar but this time they were on his head. After Michael finds and returns Jaunty to Mama Nettie, he is cursed with a powerful spell. Upon completion of his second task and after another visit with Mama Nettie, Michael receives a note from a man named Thomas Deacon whom he goes about in search of. When Michael finds Thomas, he learns about the codex, Asmodeus and the Grigori, as well as their plan to cause Armageddon. It is once again up to Michael, or Shadow Man, to save the world.</div>
