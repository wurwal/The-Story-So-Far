                <h1>Spider-Man 2 (2023 Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Peter starts his first day as a physics teacher at Brooklyn Visions Academy with Miles among his students, but they are interrupted by a rampaging Sandman, requiring both Spider-Men to subdue him. Fired for abandoning the class, Peter returns to his Aunt May's home in Queens–which he has moved into following her death[a]–to meet with Mary Jane. They are surprised by Harry, who has miraculously recovered from his terminal illness. Harry hires Peter to work at his environmental technology startup, the Emily-May Foundation (Named after Aunt May and Harry's mother Emily), so they can pursue his dream of "healing the world". Concurrently, Kraven and his Hunters infiltrate New York.<br><br>While overseeing a prisoner transfer, a vengeful Miles fails to stop the Hunters from capturing Martin Li, who previously killed his father Jefferson Davis.[a] While investigating Kraven, Peter discovers he is hunting super-powered individuals in search of an "equal" before he dies of cancer. Having already killed Scorpion, Vulture, Shocker, and Electro, Kraven attempts to capture Black Cat. However, Miles helps her escape to Paris. While visiting Coney Island to reconnect, Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry witness the Hunters attack the park to capture a reformed Tombstone. While Peter rescues civilians, he is assisted by a super-powered Harry, who learns about Peter's double life and reveals that he was cured by Curt Connors via a powerful organic exosuit that physically augments his body, on his father Norman Osborn’s insistence.<br><br>With the exosuit's powers rapidly developing, Harry helps Peter rescue Tombstone while Mary Jane discovers that Kraven has kidnapped Connors. The trio attempt to save Connors, but Kraven forcibly turns him back into the Lizard. Kraven mortally wounds Peter, who is saved when the exosuit transfers itself to his body. After Peter confronts the Hunters with his newly enhanced powers, Kraven develops an interest in hunting Peter personally.<br><br>After Peter and Harry synthesize an antidote for Connors, Peter locates him with Miles' help and eventually defeats and cures him. Upon seeing Peter wearing the exosuit, Connors explains that it is actually an alien called a symbiote, which Oscorp obtained years prior, and warns Peter to destroy it. Under the symbiote's corrupting influence, Peter refuses and keeps it for himself despite learning that Harry's illness has returned, straining their friendship. As Peter goes on a symbiote-induced rampage against the Hunters, Kraven captures Miles and forces him to fight Li. Miles overcomes his anger towards Li and helps him escape, directing him to find Peter. Once Li informs him of Miles' location, Peter arrives to storm Kraven’s fortress in an effort to rescue him and nearly kills Kraven before Miles intervenes and convinces him to remove the symbiote.<br><br>Peter takes the symbiote to Oscorp to destroy it, but a desperate Harry intercepts him and reclaims it, transforming into a monstrous creature. After slaughtering Oscorp staff who are preparing to remove the symbiote from him, the symbiote-induced Harry escapes into Times Square, where he kills several of Kraven's Hunters before overpowering and killing Kraven himself. Introducing itself as Venom, the symbiote convinces Harry to "heal the world" by infecting everyone in it with symbiotes, starting with New York. Amidst this, Venom transforms Mary Jane into Scream, but Peter helps her break free after battling and reconciling with her. As Peter and Miles attempt to stop Venom, Peter is debilitated by a trace amount of the symbiote still in him. After Miles settles his differences with Li, the latter uses his powers to convert it into the Anti-Venom symbiote, which can destroy other symbiotes. Concurrently, Venom recovers the meteorite that originally brought him to Earth and empowers himself with it, accelerating the invasion. Peter and Miles distract Venom while Mary Jane steals the meteorite and destroys it with the EMF's particle accelerator, destroying Venom's spawn. At Harry's insistence, Peter destroys Venom, freeing Harry from its control, but rendering Harry comatose.<br><br>In the aftermath, Mary Jane quits the Daily Bugle to run her own podcast and moves in with Peter, who opts to take a break from being Spider-Man to focus on rebuilding the EMF, trusting Miles to protect the city. Norman blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery and visits an imprisoned Otto Octavius to demand their secret identities, but Octavius refuses, taking glee in Norman's suffering. Miles completes his college essay and meets Rio's new boyfriend, Albert Moon, who introduces them to his daughter Cindy.</div>
