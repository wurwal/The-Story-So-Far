                <h1>Astro Bot</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">One day, in space, a mothership resembling the PlayStation 5 console is seen flying around the cosmos, featuring Astro and numerous bots resembling him, representing his entire crew. They suddenly encounter a green alien named Space Bully Nebulax, who chases after the mothership, attacks the crew and steals its CPU. This causes the mothership to explode, with its parts scattered throughout space, and the Bots stranded in other planets.<br><br>Shortly after the attack, what is left of the mothership crash-lands on a desert-based planet, and Astro, knocked unconscious, is revived by the Dual Speeder, a much smaller ship resembling the DualSense controller. A satellite crashes down the planet below, and as Astro activates it, he begins the search for his fellow Bots, and in pursuit of the missing parts of the mothership. Shortly after Astro explores his first planet, the mothership reactivates itself, and the crash site is turned into an oasis and settlement for Astro and the rescued Bots.<br><br>Astro continues to explore the galaxies, rescuing most of the Bots until he tracks down the home planets of each boss representing it: Gorilla Nebula (Mighty Chewy), Tentacle System (Wako Tako), Serpent Starway (Lady Venomara), Camo Cosmos (Mecha Leon) and Feather Cluster (Falcon McFly), fighting them all along the way and retrieving lost parts of the mothership in the process. As soon as Astro has recovered a majority of his crew, and that the mothership had been fully repaired after exploring all galaxies, he encounters Space Bully Nebulax once again and gives chase, initiating an intergalactic war in the process, with most of the crew using older PlayStation hardware as part of their squadron, thus forming the PlaySquadron.<br><br>After a lengthy fight across the universe, Astro and his fellow Bots reach Space Bully Nebulax for one last battle in order to retrieve the missing CPU. Moments later, Astro is able to retrieve the CPU, which inserts itself to the mothership, but not without a severely injured Nebulax picking one more fight. With the help of the Bots, Astro is able to blow up the UFO within Nebulax’s body, but this causes a black hole in the process. Nebulax grabs Astro, aiming to take him along his incoming demise, while the Bots do whatever they can to rescue him, although Astro sacrifices himself in the process, leading to a supernova. With the Bots fearing Astro's fate from the battle, he emerges from the horizon and lands on top of the mothership, but collapses and dies as his robotic limbs fall out one by one. Some of the Bots find and toss replacement parts for Astro as the mothership’s repair systems use them to repair and revive him. Having been resurrected, Astro celebrates with his crew and explores through space once more as the credits roll, before departing one last time on his Dual Speeder.</div>
