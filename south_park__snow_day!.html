                <h1>South Park  Snow Day!</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Eric Cartman comes home during an intense blizzard, excited over the prospect of a day off from school, while his mother, Liane, is shocked by the damage and casualties reported on the news. At night, Eric prays to God for a snow day, and in the morning, the news states that all Park County schools are to be closed. Afterwards, he jubilantly goes outside and tells everyone, including the New Kid, to get outside and play. Once everyone is in their fantasy costumes, Cartman tells the New Kid that he and the boys have set up a new set rules after the New Kid became too powerful the last two times, but due to disagreements, the town's children are at war with each other over which version of the rules are best. Cartman also mentions how Clyde Donovan has information about how the elves, led by Kyle Broflovski, are planning to attack Kupa Keep and tells the New Kid to investigate. After Kyle is defeated, Cartman questions him at Kupa Keep on why he was planning the attack. Kyle denies this and states that he was planning to talk to Stan Marsh, who he suspects to be responsible for the blizzard.<br><br>Cartman sends the New Kid to Stan's Marshwalker territory, but Stan has obtained a powerful axe in a quest, and instantly defeats the New Kid. This leads to Cartman insisting on putting the New Kid on a quest to find the same power that Stan has. After a fight with Kenny McCormick, the New Kid meets with Jimbo Kern and Ned Gerblansky, who are trying to fend off townspeople who are desperate for food and toilet paper. Jimbo agrees to help the New Kid who is to find several items desired by the townspeople. Other quests involve lighting braziers in SoDoSoPa, and stealing porn from sixth graders, who almost run over the New Kid's party with a snow plow. Eventually, the New Kid becomes powerful enough to fight Stan, who gets help from his father, Randy, who works cannons at his fortress in order to keep toilet paper from getting stolen, and defeats him. Stan later reveals at Kupa Keep that he had access to dark matter from Mr. Hankey, who became vengeful after being banished from the town over his offensive tweets in the events of "The Problem with a Poo".<br><br>Cartman, being faced with the prospect of the blizzard's end which means returning to school, betrays the New Kid and brainwashes townspeople through dark matter-infused hot chocolate. After being defeated by the New Kid, Cartman decides to join the fight against Mr. Hankey, and heads off with the boys to Hell's Pass Hospital which Mr. Hankey has turned into a fortress. Once they arrive to the top, Mr. Hankey absorbs the New Kid's dark matter, turns into a giant worm named Scheisse Hulud and fights the boys, but is eventually defeated by toilet paper cannons, ending the blizzard. As the snow melts, and Cartman reflects on having to go back to school, Jesus arrives to express disappointment towards the boys for not forgiving Mr. Hankey. The boys go to a toilet in Kyle's house and apologize to Mr. Hankey for abandoning him, in which he quickly forgives them. The boys ask for one more snow day and Mr. Hankey obliges, putting the town in another blizzard immediately after.</div>
