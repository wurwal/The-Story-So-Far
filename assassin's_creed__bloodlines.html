                <h1>Assassin'S Creed  Bloodlines</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">A few months after the events of Assassin's Creed, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, now the Mentor of the Assassin Brotherhood, learns of a plan of the remaining Templars to escape to Cyprus, and so infiltrates one of their strongholds in Acre to stop them. Although he fails to prevent the Templars' escape, he does defeat and capture Maria Thorpe, who attempted to avenge her former master, Robert de Sablé, who died at Altaïr's hands. Managing to charter a ship, Altaïr also heads to Cyprus in pursuit of the Templars, with Maria in tow.<br><br>Once there, he learns of the presence of Armand Bouchart, who has succeeded Robert de Sablé as Grand Master of the Templar Order. Altaïr gains the assistance of a resistance movement on Cyprus opposed to the presence of the Templars, who, after purchasing the island from King Richard, have formed a repressive government to control the land and its people. He also learns of a Templar "archive", a trove of Templar knowledge and artifacts, hidden somewhere on the island. True to the way of the Assassins, Altaïr manages to both locate the archive and free Cyprus from Bouchart's grip, after assassinating all of his underlings: Frederick "the Red"; Moloch "the Bull"; Shalim and Shahar "the Twins", and the Dark Oracle "the Witch". Eventually, Altaïr confronts Bouchart himself inside the archive, whose contents have been evacuated and relocated by the Templars, and kills him as the archive begins to collapse, although Altaïr manages to escape.<br><br>The game also details the relationship between Altaïr and Maria. At first, Maria is hostile and sarcastic towards Altaïr (in her own words, "the man who spared my neck but stole my life"), but as the story develops, she gradually warms to the Assassin who, despite her repeated escape attempts, repeatedly rescues her from harm and does not punish her. Eventually, she decides to assist Altaïr by killing a Templar mole in the Cypriot resistance when he attempts to kill Altaïr, and helping him defeat Bouchart in the final battle, at this point having fallen in love with the Assassin. After escaping from the Templar archive, Maria tells Altaïr of her intentions to abandon the Templars and travel the world, with Altaïr agreeing to accompany her on her journey.</div>
