                <h1>The Legend Of Zelda  Twilight Princess</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Princess Zelda is forced to surrender when Zant, the usurper king of the Twili, invades the castle and begins to engulf Hyrule into Twilight. In Ordon Village, ranch hand Link pursues Bulbins who have kidnapped the village's children, and encounters a wall of Twilight. Pulled beyond the wall, Link transforms into a wolf and meets Midna afterwards. After accepting to help her, Midna guides Link to Zelda, who instructs the pair to revive the Light Spirits in the engulfred regions. After reviving a nearby Light Spirit, Link returns to his human form and is chosen as the hero of the gods. The pair travels through Hyrule and revive the Spirits. Each Spirit reveals information about the Fused Shadows, a relic holding powers as strong as Zant's. On their way, Link also finds the children in Kakariko Village.<br><br>After restoring the regions to their glory and gaining the Fused Shadows, the pair is ambushed by Zant, who steals the relic and curses Link into his wolf form. Midna calls him out for his abuse of power, but Zant reveals his power to be from another source, and exposes Midna to the Light. Link brings a dying Midna to Zelda, who uses her sacred power to heal her; before mysteriously vanishing, Zelda informs Link to use the Master Sword to break Zant's curse. Successful, Link is able to transform into a wolf at will. Hyrule Castle becomes surrounded by a barrier. The pair reaches the depths of Gerudo Desert to use the Mirror of Twilight, the only known way that connects Hyrule amd the Twili's realm, only to discover Zant has destroyed it into fragments; only the true ruler of the Twili can permanently destroy it. Ancient beings known as Sages appear and reveals the fragments' locations. Before Link leaves, the Sages reveal that the Mirror was used in extremis to banish Ganondorf, leader of the Gerudo, after his execution for stealing the Triforce failed.<br><br>The pair travels through Hyrule once more and retrieves the fragments of the Mirror, also discovering his extreme powers. Link also encounters Ilya, her close friend who suffered amnesia after the Bulbin's attack, and helps to restore her memory. The Mirror retrieved, the pair crosses the Twili Realm and confronts Zant, who informs of Ganondorf's return from an oath they created. An angered Midna inadvertently kills Zant with a portion of the Fused Shadow they successfully retrieve. Returning into Hyrule, Midna uses the Fused Shadow to break the barrier, and they assault the castle, finding a returned Ganondorf, and a lifeless Zelda. With the power of the Twili, Ganondorf combats Link. Midna teleports Link and a returned Zelda outside of the castle, apparently killing her. During a duel, Link finishes Ganondorf off with the Master Sword. Before dying, Ganondorf witnesses Zant breaking their oath. Midna returns into her real form, and after an heartfelt goodbye, uses her renowned powers to permanently destroy the Mirror of Twilight. Some time later, Hyrule Castle is being rebuilt, and Link returns the children to Ordon before leaving on his own ways.</div>
