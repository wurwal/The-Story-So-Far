                <h1>Infamous (Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">InFamous is set in Empire City, a fictional metropolis based on New York City, consisting of the Neon District, where most of Empire City's businesses are concentrated, the Warren, a slum dependent on international shipping activity, and the Historic District, the location of the city government. Each district has an elevated train system and a separate power grid. The game's premise is built around the partial destruction of the Historic District by a mysterious explosion, followed by a viral epidemic that forces federal authorities to seal the only bridge leading to the mainland. A rise in violent crime overwhelms the police, resulting in societal collapse.<br><br>While the basic story of InFamous remains unchanged whether the player opts for the "Good" or "Evil" karma path, some story elements change depending on Cole's choices.<br><br>While making a delivery in the Historic District, Cole is instructed to open the package. In doing so, he activates a device known as the Ray Sphere, leveling six city blocks, nearly killing him, and granting him electrokinetic powers. Rescued by Zeke and Trish, he teaches himself to control his emerging powers. After using them in public to fight off a Reaper attack, the locals turn against Cole after he is accused of triggering the explosion, forcing him into hiding. He and Zeke engineer an assault on the sealed bridge, only to be ambushed by government forces. Separated from his friend, Cole meets Moya, an FBI agent, who persuades him to return and find her husband, John White, who was supposedly tasked with investigating a group called the First Sons. With her help, Cole restores the district's power supply, earning the attention of Sasha, who lures him into her underground lair. Cole defeats her, but the Sons abduct her before he can make her talk. Trapped in the Warren, Cole assists what remains of the police in battling the Dust Men. Alden is arrested and imprisoned, but Zeke's incompetence in guarding him allows the Dust Men to free him and massacre most of the officers. With Alden planning to reactivate the Sphere, the two patch things up and confront him, with Zeke ending up in possession of the Sphere. Giving in to his temptations, Zeke deserts Cole and takes the Sphere to Kessler.<br><br>With Alden on a murderous rampage toward the Historic District, Cole defeats him once and for all in a bridge battle. Before jumping in the water, Alden reveals that Kessler exiled him from the First Sons. White, who turns out to be an NSA agent with no connection to Moya, reaches out to Cole and explains that the Ray Sphere is designed to consume bio-energy from thousands of lives and transfer it to a single user, making them a Conduit. During their search for the Sphere, Kessler publicly challenges Cole to stop a series of bombings across the district, ending with him being forced to choose between saving Trish or her colleagues. Regardless of his choice, Cole fails to keep Trish from dying. Determined to avenge Trish, Cole tracks the Sphere to a remote pier, where he must decide whether to destroy it or use it to become even more powerful. Regardless, the Sphere releases the last of its energy, killing John before disappearing into a vortex.<br><br>Kessler then challenges Cole to a final fight in the exact location where the game began. Displaying similar, if not superior, powers to the latter, Kessler comes close to killing him, only to be foiled by Zeke. Mortally wounded by a massive energy discharge, Kessler uses his last bit of strength to transmit a message into Cole's brain. In a final twist, Kessler is revealed to be Cole from the future of an alternate timeline. While raising a family with Trish, Future Cole fails to prevent the Beast, a malevolent entity, from destroying humanity. The Beast tracked down and killed Trish and her children despite their attempts to flee. Sending himself back in time, Future Cole, adopting the name "Kessler," seized control of the First Sons, using their resources to prepare his past self for the future to come. Cole denounces Kessler's memory but recognizes that his actions have given his life a new purpose.<br><br>Two endings are possible based on what rank Cole holds at the end of InFamous. If Cole defeats Kessler as a Hero, he restores peace to Empire City and is hailed as a savior. Nevertheless, his estrangement from Zeke and Moya (although he reconciles with the former in the second game), coupled with the responsibilities of heroism, leads him to realize that he will always be alone. If Cole is Infamous, he allows Empire City to fully slip into chaos and disregards Kessler's warning about the Beast, believing himself to be the strongest being ever to exist.</div>
