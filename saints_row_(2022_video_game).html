                <h1>Saints Row (2022 Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">On the first day of work for Marshall Defense Industries, the Boss apprehends a notorious criminal known as "The Nahualli", but is denied a performance bonus by the strict superior, Gwen Theriault. Nevertheless, the Boss returns to a rented apartment to celebrate this success with friends and roommates Eli, Kevin, and Neenah. Although affiliated with rival groups (Kevin with the Idols and Neenah with Los Panteros), the four remain more loyal to each other, and often engage in criminal activities together to afford their rent and student loans.<br><br>The Boss later helps Marshall recover a stolen Mayan artifact known as the Hummingbird Codex from a Panteros smuggling convoy, narrowly evading the gang's leader, Sergio Velez. Company founder Atticus Marshall praises the Boss and promotes them to head of security of an unveiling gala for the Codex. The Idols and the Panteros both attack the gala to steal the artifact, with the former succeeding. Although the Boss saves the life of Marshall board member Myra Starr, they are fired by Atticus for failing to protect the Codex.<br><br>The following evening, Kevin and Eli attend an Idols party at a local resort, which is attacked by Los Panteros. Eli is injured, and one of the Idols' leaders is killed by the quartet after Kevin refuses an order to kill his friends. With both the Panteros and the Idols now targeting them, the group resolve to start their own criminal organization. They use an abandoned church as their headquarters, and adopt the moniker "The Saints".<br><br>The Saints take on the Idols and Los Panteros to gain territory, and to spite Marshall, the Boss helps Eli defeat Gwen in her favorite LARP tournament. To cover the operational costs, the group decide to rob a shipment of Federal Reserve cash on board a Marshall-protected train. The Boss breaks the Nahualli out of Marshall's private prison to assist them with the heist, and form a bond with him. The Saints fend off the Panteros (with the Nahualli personally killing Sergio) and escape the train with the money. The Boss and Kevin later steal the Hummingbird Codex back from the Idols' base of operations aboard a yacht, killing two more of the gang's leaders in the process.[a]<br><br>Marshall's legal counsel approaches the Saints and informs them that the group's front companies have been legally declared Marshall subsidiaries, due to the Boss having signed a non-compete agreement upon hiring. The Boss and Eli storm Marshall's headquarters to demand the return of their companies, but only find Myra Starr, as Atticus has already fled the building. Myra reveals her desire to usurp Atticus as the chairperson of the company, explaining that if Atticus were killed, the role would pass to his next of kin. Myra and the Boss collaborate to tank the company's stock price by using a Marshall tank to cause destruction in the city, triggering a vote by the board on whether to replace Atticus with Myra. The vote comes to a tie, which is broken when the Boss votes using a momentary seat granted by Myra. Atticus is either fired or killed by the Boss, and Myra uses her new position to return the Saints' assets before parting ways with them.<br><br>Several months later, the Saints hold a party to celebrate their successes. The Nahualli returns to seemingly accept the Boss' invite to officially join the gang, only to betray the Boss and bury them alive, explaining his jealousy of the Boss' life and his desire to be a replacement. His men attack the party and kidnap Eli, Kevin and Neenah, whom the Nahualli subsequently forces to act as his friends. Surviving the burial, the Boss tracks the Nahualli to a vacant casino, rescuing the other three founding Saints and killing the Nahualli in a gunfight atop a helipad. The four then toast to their friendship while enjoying the sunset on the rooftop and their control over Santo Ileso.<br><br>Saints Row is set in the fictional city of Santo Ileso, located in the American southwest and modeled after Las Vegas, Nevada. At the start of the game, the city is controlled by two warring gangs: Los Panteros, a gritty vehicle and fitness-oriented gang that runs smuggling and protection; and the Idols, an anarcho-communist gang focused on clubs and nightlife. A third faction, Marshall Defense Industries, an international private military corporation known for its high-tech weaponry, is also based in Santo Ileso, and attempts to eradicate all gang presence in the city while increasing its own influence.<br><br>The player character, known simply as "the Boss",  gets fired from  Marshall Defense Industries and decides to  form a gang, the Saints, with the help of roommates: Eli, a successful investor and business entrepreneur that plans most of the gang's operations; Kevin, an aspiring chef who formerly worked as a DJ for the Idols and handles the execution of the Saints' heists; and Neenah, an art major and ex-mechanic for Los Panteros who serves as the gang's driver.</div>
