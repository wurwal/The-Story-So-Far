                <h1>Xenoblade Chronicles (Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">The game's opening details events one year past, when Dickson, Dunban and Mumkhar were fighting a Mechon army and Mumkhar deserted them. In the process of defeating the Mechon, the Monado paralyzed Dunban's right arm. In the present, Shulk studies the Monado in Colony 9, where Dunban and Fiora live. A group of Mechon soon attack Colony 9 along with their leader, a special Faced Mechon called Metal Face. Dunban is injured when he attempts to use the Monado again, prompting Shulk to use it. He wields it with ease, and receives visions of the future from it. While the Mechon are driven back, Metal Face is immune to the Monado and seemingly kills Fiora before running out of energy and fleeing. Shulk sets out with Reyn to seek revenge and kill Metal Face, and soon Sharla, Dunban, Riki, and Melia join the party. After Shulk receives another vision, the group travels to the High Entia capital to gain entry to Prison Island. Along the way, Shulk meets Alvis, who shares his ability to wield the Monado. Upon gaining entry to Prison Island, they encounter Zanza, a giant being who is the Monado's creator and offers to improve it so that Shulk can destroy the Face Mechon, who are revealed to have Homs inside. Shulk accepts and Zanza improves the Monado, but during an attack on the capital Metal Face and another Mechon called Face Nemesis kill Zanza. In the ensuing battle, Face Nemesis is damaged to reveal an amnesiac Fiora controlling it.<br><br>Although he is initially disheartened, Shulk's comrades rally him and he sets out in pursuit of Metal Face and Fiora. During a peaceful encounter with Face Nemesis, Metal Face attacks the party and reveals himself to be Mumkhar. Egil, the leader of the Mechonis, intervenes and spirits Fiora away. On their way to the Mechonis, the party defeats Mumkhar, then faces off against Egil and Face Nemesis. After the fight, Shulk and Fiora are separated from the group, and during their time together Shulk learns that Fiora had been awake inside Face Nemesis, but another being was controlling her actions. Upon reuniting with the group, they meet a friendly Machina named Vanea, who reveals that the Bionis and Mechonis were initially at peace before the Bionis' god Zanza launched an unprovoked attack and possessed a friend of Egil, the giant who was imprisoned on Prison Island and killed. Since the battle a year ago, Egil had been working to infuse the Mechon with people from the Bionis to create Face units who would be impervious to the Monado. While going to face Egil, the other presence takes over Fiora and is revealed to be the Machina goddess Meyneth. They reach Egil as he reactivates the Mechonis and begins attacking the Bionis, seeking to prevent the Bionis from using its population as food and saving the Mechonis from another attack. Despite fighting him, Shulk manages to make him see that they both wish for a return to peace. Dickson appears and shoots Shulk, who Zanza, Dickson's master, was using as a vessel. Zanza reawakens and uses the Monado to destroy the Mechonis and steals Meyneth's Monado from Fiora's body before killing her. The party narrowly escapes with Shulk's body, with Egil sacrificing himself so they can escape.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Mechonis' destruction, pure-blooded High Entia begin transforming into Telethia, beings who exist to purge Bionis of life. While the party is initially helpless before the Telethia, Shulk awakens and manages to defeat a Telethia raid on Colony 6. Although Alvis is revealed to be a disciple of Zanza, Shulk believes there is more to him than he lets on. While making their way to Prison Island, they defeat a High Entia disciple named Lorithia, then Dickson. The party then travels to face Zanza, who declares the life of Bionis as his food and vessels and offers Shulk the chance to become his disciple. Shulk rejects the offer, and during the ensuing battle produces a new Monado. With the encouragement of Alvis, who is revealed to be the spirit of the Monado, Shulk kills Zanza. Alvis then shows Shulk Zanza's origins: both Zanza and Meyneth were originally human scientists working to create a bubble universe from the Earth, and Alvis was originally the artificial intelligence aboard the space station. However, the experiment ended in disaster, obliterating the universe and causing Zanza and Meyneth to be reborn as gods. After the new universe's birth, Zanza and Meyneth created life in their image, and Zanza created the cycle of the Bionis out of fear that he would eventually fade from existence as his creations forgot him and sought life beyond Bionis. Zanza then attacked the Mechonis, believing that Meyneth and the Machina had become insolent to him as a god and towards his vision of the world he created. With the current universe threatened with death, Alvis asks Shulk to remake the universe as its new god. Shulk declines and wishes for a world without gods, where everyone can decide their own fates. In the new universe, the survivors of Bionis and Mechonis build a new settlement and live peacefully together. Fiora is restored to her Homs form, and she and Shulk look forward to meeting the people of their boundless new world.<br><br>The setting of Xenoblade Chronicles originates from a world that was nothing but an endless ocean until two titans, the Bionis and the Mechonis,[f] came into existence and battled each other until only their frozen corpses remained. In the eons following their battle, they became the home for multiple forms of life. The Bionis is home to organic lifeforms, most prominently the humanoid Homs, who are virtually identical to humans in appearance and biology; the diminutive and furry Nopon; and the avian humanoid High Entia, whose lives span centuries. Conversely, the Mechonis is home to the mechanical humanoid Machina, whose lifespans span several millennia. Life forms emit a substance known as ether, which can be used both as a form of magic and as a source of fuel. The Monado – the namesake of Xenoblade – is a mystical ether-controlling sword that the Homs wield in the battle against the Mechonis, which grants visions of the future to its wielder when fully controlled.<br><br>The game's main character is Shulk, a young Homs mechanic who lives in Colony 9 on Bionis. During an attack on the Colony by Machina creations called Mechon, Shulk becomes the Monado's new wielder. During his journey, he is joined by Reyn, one of his childhood friends and a headstrong member of the Defence Force; Dunban, a former wielder of the Monado and the brother of Shulk's childhood friend and love interest Fiora, who also joins Shulk; Sharla, a medic and sniper from Colony 6; Melia Antiqua, a High Entia-Homs hybrid and princess of the High Entia; and Riki, a Nopon chosen as the hero of his village. Other important characters include Zanza, the god of the Bionis and the game's main antagonist; Lady Meyneth, the goddess of the Mechonis; Shulk's mentor Dickson; Mumkhar, a cowardly soldier who fought alongside Dunban and wished to wield the Monado for himself; Egil, the self-proclaimed leader of the Machina; and Alvis, a mysterious man who aids Shulk on his journey.<br><br>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition adds a new storyline, Future Connected, which is set one year after the events of the main story and takes place on the Bionis's Shoulder, an area not explored in the original game. Future Connected follows Shulk, Melia, and Riki's daughter Nene and adopted son Kino as they seek to reclaim the High Entia city of Alcamoth. The story also prominently focuses on Melia's relationship with her half sister, Tyrea, who was a minor character in the main story.</div>
