                <h1>Dino Crisis 2</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">On May 10, 2010, the United States Army's TRAT unit is deployed to investigate the disappearance of Edward City and its surrounding countryside. Their mission: Travel through the Time Gate, locate 1300 survivors and collect data remnants on the Third Energy Project. Intelligence operative Regina is brought along as an adviser due to her past experiences. During insertion, the team's camp is attacked by a pack of Velociraptor, leaving Lieutenant Dylan Morton, Regina and TRAT operative David as the only survivors. The velociraptors flee when a Tyrannosaurus rex attacks the group. David damages the tyrannosaur's eye with a rocket-propelled grenade to ensure Dylan and Regina's escape. Regina returns to the transport ship while Dylan heads into the jungle, spotting a mysterious helmeted figure while investigating a military facility. Upon arrival, he is confronted by the wounded T. rex. While escaping to the barracks, he is shot at by helmeted attackers. Later, he attempts to retrieve a key card, triggering a security alert that imprisons him.<br><br>Regina receives Dylan's distress call and rescues him. While rescuing Dylan after defeating an Allosaurus, Regina captures one of the mysterious attackers, a blonde teenage girl who is unable to speak. When they return to their ship, they find the engine room ransacked, stranding the heroes in the past, while the teenage girl exhibits a familiar connection to Dylan and tries to reach out to him, but this leaves him confused for a short time.<br><br>At the Research Facility teeming with Oviraptor and a thieving Compsognathus, Dylan discovers human containment chambers and a starter battery for the ship in order to get it mobile. Dylan returns to find the girl has escaped and theorizes that the helmeted attackers could be from a different time period. They use the repaired ship to reach the offshore Third Energy facility.<br><br>Regina uses a diving suit at the facility to investigate the underwater reactor, battling Mosasaurus and a Plesiosaurus along the way. Once topside, she and Dylan receive a distress call from David, who has found survivors at Edward City. First, they traverse a volcano infested with Inostrancevia and a nesting site full of angry Allosaurus, and then come across a dying Triceratops fawn. Dylan and Regina are disgusted as to who would do such a thing, and then, the fawn cries out, alerting adult Triceratops which chase them through the forest via a truck. However, after crashing into a grassy lowland and surviving a raptor attack thanks to David's use of a helicopter, Dylan and Regina arrive too late. Upon splitting up, Dylan engages the T. rex with a tank before being jumped by another helmeted figure. The blonde girl saves Dylan from the figure - accidentally dropping a silver necklace in the process - and runs away. Deciding they have no business at Edward City anymore, Regina heads to a missile silo in the jungle.<br><br>Regina discovers the Third Energy data at the silo, but is confronted by the Tyrannosaurus. Her savior is a gargantuan Giganotosaurus that kills it in a vicious one-sided brawl. The Giganotosaurus follows Regina inside the missile silo, causing damage that triggers a countdown to launch. Regina ignites gas vents to incinerate the head of the Giganotosaurus, rendering it comatose. Regina stops the countdown, but the beast awakens from its coma and smashes the missile to the ground, destroying the base. While evacuating Regina, David and Dylan open the doorway on the river: suddenly, Dylan is attacked and injured by an Allosaurus. In order to save him, David sacrifices himself by throwing Dylan into the river before getting eaten by the allosaur.<br><br>Downriver, Dylan arrives at another research facility and encounters the blonde-haired girl. Inside, she plays a hologram recording of an elderly Dylan from 2055 and learns the origins of the disaster.  The overload in 2009 caused time alterations to the Cretaceous Period, affected the earth's history dramatically, creating an alternate timeline where humanity did not exist. To fix this, an international organization enacted the "Noah's Ark Plan": utilizing the Time gate technology, they would transport the living organisms of the Cretaceous to a different time period, three million years in the future, with similar environments, where they could thrive unaffected by the alterations. With the distortions prevented, the organisms would then be returned to their original time period. However, when the Noah's Ark team attempted to return, the gate overloaded and was destroyed, stranding both the dinosaurs and humans in the future. The helmeted attackers are revealed to be the only remaining children of the survivors, who were brought to the safety of a facility and placed in special life support chambers for growth and learning. The side-effects of the chambers cost the children's ability to speak and allowed them to co-exist with the dinosaurs, attacking anyone who threatened them. Dylan also learns at this point that the blonde girl is his future daughter, Paula. The hologram instructs Dylan there is a basic gate they can use to go home, but it will work only once, asking Dylan to take Paula with him.<br><br>The facility's self destruct system is activated by the sole surviving helmeted figure. Paula flees, and Dylan and the helmeted figure wrestle each other to the floor, but the brawl is cut short when the Giganotosaurus, revealed to have survived the warhead explosion despite getting burned, appears from the shadows. The helmeted figure is tossed off a foot bridge and killed, while Dylan incinerates the beast with an orbital laser. While attempting to evacuate with Regina, an earth tremor leaves Paula trapped by falling equipment. Unable to free her and with the building ready to explode, Dylan stays with his daughter, telling Regina to return home with the Third Energy data and save them at an earlier time period.</div>
