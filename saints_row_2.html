                <h1>Saints Row 2</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Five years after the explosion on Richard Hughes' yacht, the player character (Charles Shaughnessy, Kenn Michael, Alex Mendoza, Katie Semine, G. K. Bowes, or Rebecca Sanabria), who was the sole survivor, awakens from a coma within the infirmary of Stilwater's maximum security prison after undergoing extensive plastic surgery. They escape to Stilwater with the help of Carlos Mendoza (Joe Camareno), the brother of a former 3rd Street Saints member.<br><br>Carlos explains that the Saints have since disbanded, with most members being arrested by Troy Bradshaw (Michael Rapaport), an undercover cop who had infiltrated the gang as a lieutenant and has since become chief of police, using his influence to protect the imprisoned Saints. In the gang's absence, three new gangs have taken over the city: the Brotherhood, a metalhead gang who conduct gun-running operations; the Ronin, a Japanese bosozoku gang who conduct gambling and porn operations; and the Sons of Samedi, a Haitian Vodou gang who run drugs operations. Also, the Saints' former base of operations, the Saint's Row district, has been redeveloped into a pristine commercial and residential area by the Ultor Corporation, who have further plans for Stilwater.<br><br>The player works to rebuild the Saints, rescuing their former lieutenant Johnny Gat (Daniel Dae Kim) from his trial. The pair then recruit new members, including Carlos and Gat's acquaintances, Pierce Washington (Arif S. Kinchen) and Shaundi (Eliza Dushku), as lieutenants, and set up a new headquarters in a hotel destroyed by an earthquake. Afterwards, the player steps up as the Saints' new leader, now going under the moniker of "The Boss", and declares war on the rival gangs, assigning their lieutenants to discover more about each.<br><br>Gat and Pierce focus on the Ronin, led by Shogo Akuji (Yuri Lowenthal) and his second-in-command, Jyunichi (Brian Tee) â€“ on behalf of Shogo's father, Kazuo, who leads international operations. After the Saints rob their casino, the Ronin retaliate by infiltrating the home of Gat's girlfriend Aisha (Sy Smith), killing her and severely wounding Gat. Once Gat recovers, he and the Boss retaliate by killing Jyunichi (who was sold out by Shogo out of envy for Jyunichi's closer bond with Kazuo), burying Shogo alive after he ambushes them at Aisha's funeral, and ultimately killing Kazuo, ending the Ronin.<br><br>Carlos researches the Brotherhood, led by Maero (Michael Dorn). After the Boss rejects Maero's deal to join forces and split their profits (80% to the Brotherhood and 20% to the Saints), a series of rebound retaliations result in the deaths of Carlos (who is dragged by a speeding truck and forcibly mercy killed by the Boss) and Maero's girlfriend Jessica (Jaime Pressly) (who the Boss locks in her car to be inadvertently crushed by Maero with his monster truck). After assaulting the Brotherhood's base and forcing Maero to flee, the Boss kills him during a demolition derby to end the Brotherhood.<br><br>Shaundi investigates the Sons of Samedi, led by "The General" (Greg Eagles) and his right-hand, Mr. Sunshine (Phil LaMarr). After the Saints disrupt the Samedi's operations and steal most of their customers, Samedi lieutenant and one of Shaundi's exes, DJ Veteran Child (Neil Patrick Harris), is forced by the gang to kidnap Shaundi. After The Boss kills Veteran Child to rescue Shaundi, they continue their war on the Samedi by destroying their drug factories and killing Mr. Sunshine. Since The General runs his gang from an armored limo that's constantly on the move, The Boss and Shaundi hack the city's police street camera system to track it. Afterwards, they set up an ambush as the limo drives past the city mall and manage to take out The General, ending the Sons of Samedi.<br><br>After defeating the rival gangs, the Saints find themselves targeted by Ultor's power-hungry CEO, Dane Vogel (Jay Mohr), who was playing the gangs against each other to lower real estate throughout Stilwater and allow Ultor to purchase it and redevelop. After fending off several attacks by Ultor's private security forces, the Saints retaliate by destroying one of the company's labs and killing its board of directors. Taking advantage of this to assume full control of Ultor, Vogel decides to personally deal with the Saints, but is ambushed by the Boss at a press conference. The Boss fights their way to Vogel's office and kills him, allowing the Saints to return ruling over Stilwater undisputed.<br><br>At any point during the game, the Boss can listen to wiretap conversations at the police station, which reveal that after being arrested and asked to disband the Saints by Troy, former Saints leader Julius Little (Keith David) planted the bomb on Hughes' yacht to kill the Boss, knowing they would refuse, then retired. The Boss calls former Saints lieutenant Dex Jackson, who left the gang to work for Ultor, to discuss their findings, only to confront Julius instead at the Saints' old church. Realizing Dex led them to a trap, the pair fend off an attack by Ultor's security forces. Afterwards, the Boss shoots and injures Julius, who calls them out for straying away from the Saints ideals. Unmoved, the Boss finishes Julius off.</div>
