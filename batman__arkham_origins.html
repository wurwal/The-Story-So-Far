                <h1>Batman  Arkham Origins</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">On Christmas Eve, Batman intervenes in a jailbreak at Blackgate Penitentiary led by Black Mask, who executes Police Commissioner Loeb and escapes. Left to battle the hired assassin Killer Croc, Batman prevails but learns that Croc is the first of eight of the world's deadliest assassins drawn to Gotham City to claim a $50 million bounty placed on Batman by Black Mask. Hoping to learn Black Mask's location, Batman tracks Penguin to his ship. There, he defeats the assassins Deathstroke and Electrocutioner and learns from the Penguin that Black Mask was purportedly murdered at an apartment complex. Batman investigates the murder scene, learning that the victim was not Black Mask and that the murder involved a criminal known as "Joker".<br><br>Needing more information, Batman breaks into the GCPD to access its national criminal database. While escaping, he encounters Captain James Gordon, who is distrusting of Batman, and the corrupt SWAT team who hope to collect the bounty money for themselves. Following advice from Gordon's daughter Barbara, Batman enters the sewers beneath the GCPD to install permanent access to the database and finds Black Mask's crew planting explosives. Using the database, Batman deduces that Black Mask was kidnapped by Joker, presumably to access the Gotham Merchants Bank. At the bank, Black Mask removes his disguise for Batman and reveals himself as Joker. Having assumed Black Mask's identity several days prior, Joker seized his criminal empire and imposed the bounty on Batman. Batman chases Joker to the Sionis Steel Mill where he frees Black Mask and defeats the poisonous assassin Copperhead.<br><br>Tracking the Joker to the Gotham Royal Hotel, Batman discovers that the villain and his men have filled the hotel with explosives, murdered the staff, and taken the guests hostage. Joker berates the assassins for their failure to kill Batman, throwing Electrocutioner out a window to his death: Batman recovers his electric gloves. The assassins leave to search for Batman, except for Bane who anticipates that Batman will come to the Joker. After traversing the building, Batman finds the Joker on the roof and is forced to battle Bane. Thinking Batman is outmatched, Alfred alerts the police so they will intervene. As Bane escapes by helicopter, he fires a rocket at the Joker who is sent plummeting from the hotel by the concussive force. Batman rescues the Joker, confounding Joker as to why Batman would save someone like him. The Joker is arrested and imprisoned in Blackgate under the care of Dr. Harleen Quinzel.  He tells Quinzel that he and Batman were destined to meet.<br><br>In the Batcave, Alfred begs Batman to abandon his crusade out of concern he will be killed, but Batman refuses. Batman also learns that Bane has deduced his true identity as Bruce Wayne. Firefly attacks the Pioneers Bridge, forcing Batman and Gordon to work together to incapacitate the assassin and his bombs. Meanwhile, Bane breaks into the Batcave and attacks Alfred. Batman finds the cave in ruins and Alfred dying, but is able to revive him with Electrocutioner's gloves. Alfred admits that Gotham needs Batman to stop men like Bane. Elsewhere, Joker has taken over Blackgate after inciting a riot.<br><br>Realizing he needs allies, Batman works with Gordon and the police to retake the prison. Sitting at the electric chair, Joker offers Batman a choice: kill Bane or allow Bane's heartbeat to charge a device that will activate the chair and kill the Joker. Batman uses the electric gloves to stop Bane's heart. Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane who injects himself with TN-1, a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect of the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but he is instead subdued. Gordon chooses not to pursue Batman, believing he can help the city.<br><br>In a radio interview during the credits, Quincy Sharp says he will lobby to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the city's worst criminals. In the post-credits scene, an imprisoned Deathstroke is approached by Amanda Waller to join her Suicide Squad.<br><br>Arkham Origins features a large ensemble cast of characters from the history of Batman comics. The main character is Batman (Roger Craig Smith), a superhero trained to the peak of human physical perfection and an expert in martial arts who is aided by his butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Martin Jarvis). Arkham Origins brings Batman into conflict with sadistic, brutal crime lord Black Mask (Brian Bloom). The most powerful man in the city and ruler of Gotham's criminal underworld, Black Mask has vast wealth and resources, has eliminated his opposition and is consolidating his power. His ebony mask conceals his identity, allowing him to operate publicly as Roman Sionis (head of Janus Cosmetics). Black Mask has a bounty on Batman, which attracts eight accomplished assassins: the physically imposing Bane (JB Blanc); expert marksman Deadshot; veteran mercenary Deathstroke (Mark Rolston);  poisonous contortionist Copperhead (Rosa Salazar); the pyromaniac Firefly (Crispin Freeman); the highly charged Electrocutioner (Steve Blum); deformed criminal Killer Croc (Khary Payton), and master martial artist Shiva (Kelly Hu).<br><br>Batman is considered an outlaw by the Gotham City police, and is pursued by Captain James Gordon (Michael Gough), Detective Harvey Bullock (Robert Costanzo) and corrupt GCPD officials Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and SWAT team leader Howard Branden. Other characters include the psychopathic Joker (Troy Baker); black-market weapons dealer Penguin (Nolan North); the mind-controlling Mad Hatter (Peter MacNicol); anti-government, anti-corporate anarchist Anarky (Matthew Mercer); rogue hacker Enigma (Wally Wingert); Alberto Falcone; Gordon's teenage daughter Barbara, and Blackgate warden Martin Joseph (Khary Payton). The story takes place before Batman's partnership with Robin (Josh Keaton)—although Robin is a playable character outside the main story—and before Barbara becomes Batman's ally, Oracle. Dr. Harleen Quinzel (Tara Strong), Gotham News Network (GNN) reporter Vicki Vale, Amanda Waller (CCH Pounder), Quincy Sharp (Tom Kane), and Calendar Man make cameo appearances in the game. Mr. Freeze (Maurice LaMarche) appears in the downloadable content, Cold, Cold Heart.</div>
