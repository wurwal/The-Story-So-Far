                <h1>Lost In Blue 2</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">A short cut scene plays, showing the player character on a sinking ship. The player has the option to search their suitcase, the closet, or the table. They gain something from choosing one of them, but it can sometimes be unclear what. After the cut scene, the character (Amy or Jack, depending whom the player chooses at the start of the game) wakes up on the beach. This part is similar to a cut scene in that the characters on the screen are moving and speaking without the player's control, but is illustrated just like the actual game, not like the cell-shaded opening. These "auto-scenes" occur whenever they hit an important turning point in the game. The character says that they should look for survivors. At this point, game play begins and the player is free to wander the beach. At a certain point, they will be near enough to the partner character, and an auto-scene will introduce the two of them.<br><br>Their first goals are to find food, shelter, and water. Once they find shelter in a nearby cave, the next few days are spent gathering enough food, water, and firewood to survive each day's labors. After several days of gameplay, the character will be able to start exploring their surroundings and finding the different areas of the island. Along the journey the character will fish, hunt game, build furniture, build a treehouse, develop several different tools, explore myriad cooking methods, and gather items from the beach, jungle, forest, and grasslands. They must also fight/avoid enemies like wolves, snakes, spiders, tigers, crocodiles, and gorillas. The eventual goal is, of course, rescue.<br><br>The game provides several different ending scenarios that depend upon the actions the character takes during the game, such as being saved by a helicopter. If the character's health meter reaches zero, they will die and the game will be over. However, there are several ways to get rescued, such as by radio or helicopter, and there is a 365-day limit to the game. If the characters make it 365 days, the game automatically ends, and they are still on the island, but they will win and survive.<br><br>The main characters are Jack and Amy, two young teenagers who have been shipwrecked on a deserted island. The player chooses to be either Jack, the boy character, or Amy, the girl character. The player takes on most of the responsibilities of the camp, but they are able to request favors of their partner, such as cooking, making rope from vines, or collecting firewood. Each character has special skills, e.g., Jack is able to climb twice as high as his female companion, is better at cooking food, and is a stronger fighter. On the other hand, Amy is a better swimmer, can find food more easily, and has a steadier aim with ranged weapons when hunting animals.</div>
