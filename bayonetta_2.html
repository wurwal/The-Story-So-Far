                <h1>Bayonetta 2</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">A few months after the first Bayonetta, Bayonetta is shopping on Christmas Eve with Enzo when angels suddenly attack New York City. Teaming up with fellow witch and friend Jeanne, she is on the verge of winning until a demon summoning goes wrong. Jeanne saves Bayonetta from the familiar's attack, but the attack causes Inferno to claim her soul. Bayonetta destroys the demon and resolves to save Jeanne. At the same time, a masked Lumen Sage is brought to the present by a mysterious figure, known as the Prophet, who promises him the chance for revenge.<br><br>Upon a tip from her informant Luka, Bayonetta heads to the mountain of Fimbulventr, in the city of Noatun, which houses an entrance to Inferno. In Noatun, she meets a boy called Loki, who is trying to reach Fimbulventr for reasons he cannot remember. The two strike a deal to travel together as Loki claims his powers will be needed in order to reach Inferno. On the way, they learn about some of Loki's lost memories, but are constantly attacked by angels and demons. Loki is hunted by the Lumen Sage and the Prophet, who knows Loki. There, they encounter Luka, Bayonetta’s acquaintance and news journalist. Luka explains to them the Legend of Aesir: Aesir was once the ruler of the Chaos realm, and has created the Left Eye of Darkness and Right Eye of Light (also known as Eyes of the World) to humanity to grant humankinds free will. Both eyes were entrusted for ownership and safekeeping by both the Lumen Sage and Umbra Witch clan. Due to the death of the allegedly last Lumen Sage, Father Balder by Bayonetta and Jeanne, the Right Eye of Lightness had disappeared, which prompted Luka to investigate the consequences to the planet, and if it is connected to the natural disasters that has been occurring.<br><br>The Prophet shows Bayonetta a vision that implies the Witch Hunts 500 years ago were not caused by Balder.<br><br>Bayonetta reaches Inferno and travels into its depths to save Jeanne. With the help of Rodin, Bayonetta is able to save Jeanne's soul and revive her. However, the Sage attacks Loki again and reveals himself to be a young Balder. Bayonetta saves Loki from him, but Loki loses control of his powers and sends Bayonetta and Balder 500 years into the past. Now in Vigrid during the Witch Hunts, Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa, and the two work together to fight back against the angels. When they become separated, Bayonetta encounters Loptr, a doppelgänger of Loki who is the Prophet in the present. Loptr claims that the Eyes of the World, one of which Bayonetta possesses, belong to him. Later meeting with the young Balder, Bayonetta arrives too late to stop Loptr from murdering Rosa. Bayonetta realizes that Loptr has tricked Balder into seeking revenge on Loki in the present. The two of them decide to work together and return to the present to stop Loptr. Meanwhile, in the present, Luka encounters Loki, who claims to remember everything, and asks Luka to take him to Fimbulventr.<br><br>With Jeanne's help, Bayonetta and Balder reach the top of Fimbulventr and find Loptr having already captured Loki. Loptr explains that he and Loki were once the God of Chaos, Aesir, the creator of the Eyes of the World. Aesir had split his power amongst humanity to create the Eyes but had also split his soul into two halves of good and evil in the process. Loki, the good half, was given the power to control the Eyes directly, which Loptr steals. Despite their efforts, Loptr takes both of the Eyes from Balder and Bayonetta and transforms into Aesir with the intent to rule humanity. Loki claims that Aesir's power can erase anything from existence, and uses that power to destroy the Eyes, weakening Loptr and allowing Bayonetta and Balder to destroy his body with Jeanne's help. Loptr's soul attempts to escape to a time where the Eyes still exist to try his plan again. Balder stops him and absorbs his soul, despite Loki warning him that doing so will corrupt him. Balder reveals he knows that Bayonetta is his daughter and asks her to stop him should he be corrupted, and is returned to his time. With Loptr and the Eyes gone, Loki says he plans to take a break from the world's affairs, but that he may meet Bayonetta again, and fades away.<br><br>Some days after, Bayonetta and Jeanne are shopping again. Suddenly, another attack begins, and Bayonetta teams up with Jeanne to battle them again.<br><br>In a post-credits scene, Balder is shown returning to his time period, now corrupted, setting up the events of the first Bayonetta.<br><br>Most of Bayonetta 2 takes place on the fictional sacred mountain of Fimbulventr and the nearby town of Noatun, both located in the Middle East. The main character Bayonetta (Hellena Taylor / Atsuko Tanaka) travels to the mountain to find the Gates of Hell to save her friend Jeanne (Grey DeLisle-Griffin / Mie Sonozaki).<br><br>Returning characters include Rodin (Dave Fennoy / Tesshō Genda), the bartender of Gates of Hell who supplies Bayonetta with powerful weapons; Luka (Yuri Lowenthal / Daisuke Namikawa), a journalist who provides Bayonetta with valuable information; and Enzo (John Kassir / Wataru Takagi), an informant who provides comic relief. New characters include Loki (Mark Daugherty / Junko Minagawa), an amnesiac boy who guides Bayonetta to the mountain; the Masked Lumen (Crispin Freeman / Takehito Koyasu), a powerful Sage and Bayonetta's new rival; and Loptr (TJ Ramini / Takumi Yamazaki), a mysterious Prophet apparently allied with the Masked Lumen.</div>
