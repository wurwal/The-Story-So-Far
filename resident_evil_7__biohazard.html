                <h1>Resident Evil 7  Biohazard</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In 2017, Ethan Winters, a civilian with an unknown background, is drawn to a derelict plantation in Dulvey, Louisiana, by a message from his wife Mia, who has been missing for the past three years. Exploring a seemingly abandoned guest house, Ethan finds Mia imprisoned in the basement. She is distressed to see him, saying that she did not contact him at all. During their escape, Mia suddenly goes berserk and attacks Ethan, forcing him to kill her. After receiving a call from a woman named Zoe offering assistance, Ethan is attacked again by a revived Mia, who cuts off his left hand. He manages to subdue her but he is then, in turn, subdued by Jack Baker, patriarch of the Baker family. He then drags Ethan and Mia to the main house where Zoe staples Ethan's hand back on. He is held captive by Jack, his wife Marguerite, their son Lucas, and an elderly wheelchair-using woman. Although Ethan escapes his captors, he is repeatedly confronted by Jack, who demonstrates the ability to regenerate from fatal wounds and even dismemberment.<br><br>After Ethan manages to subdue Jack by destroying his upper body, Zoe contacts Ethan again, saying she is the Bakers' daughter. She informs him that she, her family, and Mia are all infected with the same ailment, but can be cured with a special serum, which they need to obtain from Marguerite. Ethan makes his way to an old house to retrieve the serum, where he manages to kill Marguerite. After recovering the ingredients, Ethan experiences visions of an unknown young girl. Lucas captures Zoe and Mia before Ethan's return, and forces him to navigate a booby-trapped barn to find them. Ethan outwits Lucas, causing him to flee, and frees Zoe and Mia. Zoe then develops two serum doses, but Jack, now heavily mutated, attacks Ethan, who, on Zoe's advice, uses one dose to seemingly kill him. Ethan must then choose to cure either Mia or Zoe.<br><br>Following either choice, Mia ends up on the wrecked ship and searches for Ethan while experiencing visions of Eveline, who refers to Mia as her mother. Eventually, Mia's memory is restored, revealing that she was a covert operative for The Connections, a criminal organization working on bio-weapon technology, that developed Eveline as a bioweapon. Mia and another agent, Alan Droney, were to escort Eveline as she was being transported aboard the tanker when Eveline realized the reality of the situation, escaped containment and started attacking and infecting everyone on board (including Alan), killing crew members and turning them into the Molded. Mia searched for Eveline throughout the ship when she meets Alan again who encouraged her to kill Eveline, when the girl kills him. She then infected Mia in an effort to force her to be her mother, when finally a hurricane sank the ship. In present time, after finding Ethan, Mia gives him a vial of Eveline's genetic material.<br><br>After leaving the shipwreck, Ethan discovers a hidden laboratory inside an abandoned salt mine. There, he learns that Eveline is a bio-organic weapon capable of infecting people with a black psychotropic fungus (referred to as the "mold") that gives her control over her victims' minds, resulting in their insanity, superhuman strength and regenerative abilities, various mutations, and turning them into the "Molded" (super organisms formed of molded filaments who are capable of defending themselves ferociously on the slightest provocation). Eveline grew up obsessed with having a family (due to her quarantined upbringing in a laboratory), influencing her to infect Mia and the Bakers, and lure Ethan to the Bakers' home. Lucas is also revealed to have been cured of  Eveline's mental control by the organization in exchange for providing observations on her. Using the lab equipment and Eveline's genetic material, Ethan synthesizes a toxin to kill her, and proceeds through a series of tunnels that lead back to the Bakers' guest house. There Ethan has visions of Eveline and also Mia when he was first attacked by her, revealing that she was having the same visions of Eveline back then commanding her to kill him. As Ethan approaches Eveline, she assaults him with wind blasts, but he overcomes them and injects her with the toxin, which doesn't kill her, but reveals she was the elderly woman in the wheelchair, who was watching Ethan all this time. As a side effect of the powers she had, Eveline had to be put on medication to keep her young, or else she would age rapidly. But since her escape, she had been aging 25 times faster than a normal human.<br><br>With the toxin taking effect, Eveline becomes susceptible to injuries and mutates into a giant molded monster but, aided by the arrival of the Umbrella forces, Ethan is able to kill her. With Eveline dead, the squad and their leader Chris Redfield extracts Ethan by helicopter. If Ethan did not cure Mia, he throws his phone containing her last message to him from the helicopter, saying "goodbye", otherwise, the canon ending has Mia rescued aboard Redfield's helicopter with Ethan by her side. As the chopper flies away, it is shown to be branded with the logo of Blue Umbrella.</div>
