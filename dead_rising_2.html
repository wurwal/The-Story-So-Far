                <h1>Dead Rising 2</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Five years after the events of Dead Rising, former motocross champion Chuck Greene is in the casino town of Fortune City, Nevada, taking part in Terror Is Reality, a controversial sports entertainment game show where contestants kill zombies for money and fame. Chuck needs the prize money to buy Zombrex, a daily medication that suppresses the zombification process, for his young daughter, Katey; who was bitten by her zombified mother during a previous outbreak in Las Vegas.<br><br>While Chuck is backstage, the show's supply of zombies are released; Chuck rescues Katey and makes his way to an emergency shelter, which is sealed after their arrival. Head of security, Raymond Sullivan is initially reluctant to let the infected Katey in, but Chuck promises to keep her supplied with Zombrex until the military arrives in three days. Chuck ventures into the city to find a dose of Zombrex. Another survivor, Stacey Forsythe, a leader of a zombie rights organization protesting their treatment by Terror Is Reality, gives Chuck a map and two-way radio, She watches the shelter's security monitors and directs Chuck to other survivors or points of interest in the area.<br><br>After giving Katey the first dose of Zombrex, a news report implicates Chuck as causing the outbreak. Chuck tracks down the reporter Rebecca Chang, at a nearby hotel and offers her a story if he can prove his innocence. From this Chuck is given three main objectives to complete: investigating the source of the outbreak; rescuing survivors from zombies; and more Zombrex to keep Katey alive until the military arrives. Chuck and Rebecca soon discover that Terror Is Reality host, Tyrone "TK" King, is using the outbreak to rob the city's casinos. Chuck foils the robberies and prevents TK from escaping in his helicopter. TK is locked up in the shelter, before revealing he's collaborating with another organization to cause the outbreak<br><br>Three days into the outbreak, the military arrives, but a green gas emanates from underground, causing the zombies to mutate into a more powerful form. The unprepared convoy is wiped out almost completely. A second military force would normally arrive 24 hours later, but media reports claim that the first convoy reached the shelter and found no survivors, so the city will be cleansed by firebombing. The safe house is sabotaged, forcing Chuck to quickly repair the door; TK is bitten, and needs Zombrex to survive. Rebecca reveals the source of the gas is in the underground access tunnels.<br><br>Chuck discovers a facility belonging to Phenotrans, the pharmaceutical company responsible for Zombrex, harvesting zombies. Zombrex manufactured from the queens of the genetically modified wasps which create zombies; driving up demand for Zombrex. Phenotrans also released the gas to increase the number of queens in a zombie horde. Killing the facility's scientists, Chuck recovers a satellite phone and a laptop and takes them to Rebecca as proof of Phenotrans involvement.<br><br>Rebecca attempts to contact her news station, but is killed by Sullivan, who is revealed as a Phenotrans operative; being the one who let the zombies loose and framed Chuck, as well as sabotaging the shelter. Stealing the evidence, Sullivan is pursued and confronted by Chuck on a casino rooftop Sullivan plans to escape by skyhook; during which Sullivan reveals Phenotrans was behind the outbreak where Chuck's wife was zombified and Katey was infected. Fighting Sullivan, Chuck handcuffs his harness to the rooftop, bisecting Sullivan as the recovery aircraft catches the skyhook.<br><br>Chuck contacts Rebecca's channel and offers to give them proof of Phenotrans' involvement in the outbreak if they send helicopters to rescue the survivors. As the helicopter picks them up, if TK was not given Zombrex, he zombifies and attacks the group, forcing Chuck to sacrifice himself to allow the others to escape. If TK was given Zombrex, he kidnaps Stacey and Katey and suspends them above a horde of zombies while challenging Chuck to a final duel. Chuck hurls TK to his death, before leaving with Katey and Stacey.</div>
