                <h1>Dragon Quest X</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">The story begins in the village of Tenton, focusing on the protagonist, an orphan living with their sibling. The peace is shattered when Nelgel, the Lord of Hell, attacks the village. The protagonist's soul is transported to a shrine and placed within the body of a member of the five non-human tribes, while their sibling is transported to the past to protect her from Nelgel. Under the guidance of a sage, the protagonist travels to Astoltia searching for sacred emblems with which to reach Nelgel's lair. After collecting six out of ten emblems, the sage attempts to form a bridge to Nelgel's lair. This fails, and he decides to separate the protagonist's soul from their body in a desperate attempt to try another method. This proves to be successful, as the protagonist then meets the body's original owner.<br><br>The protagonist's mission is made clear when they realize that a sacred vessel called the Ark of the Heavens is the only thing that can penetrate Nelgel's defenses. The protagonist then travels 500 years into the past, where the Ark of the Heavens was last used in recorded history. After fighting Razban, a demon bent on bringing Nelgel to life, the protagonist forges a friendship with a young boy who knew the secret to using the Ark of the Heavens. Returning to the present, the protagonist entered Nelgel's lair, and after a long battle, emerged successful. During the end credits, the protagonist is greeted by the sage from before, who informs them that despite Nelgel's defeat, the seal he had on the central continent was still active.<br><br>In the first expansion, the protagonist travels to Rendashia, the central continent of Astoltia where Nelgel's seal was created. The protagonist investigates the demonic events there and continues to work towards stopping Nelgel's legacy for good. In the second expansion, the protagonist becomes embroiled in a royal power struggle, at the same time as a massive monster invasion of Astoltia, controlled by a mysterious hooded man. They eventually journey to the world of Nadragand to assist an enigmatic race of dragonic people defeat an ancient evil plaguing their world. The third expansion has the protagonist travel across several periods of time in the distant past and future, hoping to stop a future where Astoltia is completely destroyed while learning of their own origins. In the fourth expansion, the protagonist travels to the world of the demons themselves, and fights to stop an evil plaguing Astoltia since the time of its creation. In the fifth expansion, the heroic deeds that took place in the world of the demons attracts the attention of the heavens themselves, where the protagonist's new adventure takes place.</div>
