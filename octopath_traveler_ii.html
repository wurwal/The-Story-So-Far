                <h1>Octopath Traveler Ii</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">While Octopath Traveler II retains the same structure of following eight separate character's stories throughout the game, it follows eight new characters in a new setting separate from the prior games. It takes place in the world of Solistia, a setting that is more modern than the prior game's medieval setting, which is presented more like something from the nineteenth or twentieth centuries. For instance, the steam engine is pioneered during the game's events.<br><br>The game's main cast includes:<br><br>Each character has between four and five story chapters focused solely on themselves, and two "Crossed Paths" chapters, a new feature in which two travelers collaborate on a goal.<br><br>Journey for the Dawn: Once all 8 travelers' stories have been completed, as well as the crossed paths, the player will unlock the final story of the game.<br><br>The Travelers sit together in a campfire, telling each other about their goals now that their journeys are finished. However, as the Travelers sleep, four torches with blue flames are snuffed out. The Travelers wake up to find night has become eternal, and are attacked by dark monsters. The Travelers then head on one last journey to restore the dawn to the world. During this, the Travelers learn more of the Moonshade Order, and how they were tied to their journeys. Kazan, who's true name is Oboro, is a member of the order, and his true motive to aid Hikari was to get Mugen's cursed sword so he could snuff one of the flames. Ori is also a member, as well as Oboro's sister, who used her disguise of scribner to find another flame. However, her friendship with Partiio gives her hope, and ultimately causes Ori to defect from the order. Harvey joined the order, who helped him on his experiments in exchange for creating a tome for them. However the Order cut him loose once his obsession with Osvald became too troublesome to handle, and stole his tome just before his defeat. Harvey also helped create the Darkling. Claude is revealed to be an immortal prince who had the dark god Vide's blood, which made him immortal. He was meant to be the vassal of the god, but he rejected it, choosing to pass it to his best child, which would have been Throné. She however killed him before he could do anything. Claude is also revealed to be the man that made Trousseu go mad, though Castti was his original target. A woman named Petrikov is revealed to be the dark hunter who fought the legendary creates, and was the one that captured the animal not chosen by Ochette so it could be turned into the Darkling. She had the Darkling kill her to snuff one of the flames before setting the beast loose. Using the mirror Alpates gave Throné, the travelers re ignite the flames. The Travelers learn that all of the Order answers to a woman named Arcanatte, who is later revealed to be Temenos' friend Mindt. Arcanatte reveals the Order's plan is to release Vide so they can unleash eternal night, something they see as a mercy. The Travelers manage to defeat Arcanatte, but arrive to late, as Oboro gives his life to finally bring Vide back. The Travelers face Vide in a climatic showdown, where the dark god fights them in its two forms. In the end, Vide is defeated and sealed back, and the dawn is restored. With Vide and the order defeated, the Travelers bid each other farewell and part ways. Sometime later, they reunite alongside all of their allies in New Delsta to watch Agnea perform her new song, Octopath Traveler.</div>
