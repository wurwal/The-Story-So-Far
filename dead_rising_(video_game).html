                <h1>Dead Rising (Video Game)</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">In 2006, photojournalist Frank West is alerted by a source that something is happening in the town of Willamette, Colorado. On 19th September, flying into the town with helicopter pilot Ed DeLuca, Frank learns that the town is subject to a military quarantine and observes several violent incidents throughout the town. He is dropped onto the Willamette Parkview Mall's helipad, after asking Ed to return in three days.<br><br>Arriving in the mall, he learns that the quarantine is due to a zombie outbreak. The mall is breached, forcing Frank to take refuge in the mall's security room. With the help of janitor Otis Washington, he travels into the mall. After helping DHS agent Brad Garrison in a firefight against an unknown assailant, the two strike an alliance. Person of interest to Brad, Russell Barnaby is located by the two, hidden in a bookstore. Barnaby refuses to be escorted to safety, forcing the two to return to the security room where they are unable to call for assistance due to a communications jammer. Frank meets and saves several survivors who are either trapped, injured, or held captive by psychotic survivors (the main bosses of the game dubbed psychopaths) who attack Frank. The two later rescue Barnaby from the unknown assailant. Brad is injured, forcing Frank to search for medicine.<br><br>In his search, he finds the medicine required to save Brad is in the supermarket but is held by an angry and mad manager named Steve who is holding captive a woman he met during the mall's breach. After killing Steve and saving her the woman rebukes him, mentioning Santa Cabeza. Frank learns from Barnaby that Santa Cabeza was ostensibly a Central American town linked to the drug trade, which distributed drugs that had a zombifying effect. Locating the woman again on security monitors, he questions her. Revealing herself to be Isabela Keyes, sister of the unknown assailant, Carlito, she promises to set up an interview between the two.<br><br>Isabela comes to the meeting alone, after being shot in a rage by Carlito. Frank escorts Isabela to the security room, where she reveals that Santa Cabeza was home to an American research facility experimenting on cattle and that Barnaby was its head. Isabela, as a research assistant, was privy to the fact that a species of native wasp was used in an attempt to boost the performance of cattle, but instead had a zombifying effect. The wasps escaped and infected humans, forcing a U.S. military cleanup of all life in the town, with few escapees. Barnaby begins to zombify and attacks Brad's partner, Jessie McCarney, and is killed.<br><br>Isabela reveals that Carlito is planning to use the mall as a staging point to spread the parasites across the country, using bombs located in trucks. Brad and Frank disable the bombs. Brad and Carlito engage in a firefight, and Carlito is mortally wounded. Carlito manages to kick Brad out of the room, where he is injured by zombies off-screen. Frank can find him in the tunnels, where he tells Frank not to tell Jessie, and slides his handgun to Frank, implying that he wants Frank to shoot him. He will then fully turn.<br><br>Frank locates Carlito being held hostage by an insane butcher named Larry, and after killing Larry he receives Carlito's locket before Carlito dies. The photo inside the locket provides Isabela with a clue that lets her guess the password to Carlito's computer, and she shuts down the jammer. However, U.S. Special Forces arrive in the mall regardless, and have cleanup orders. Jessie is allowed to live, but she zombifies. Otis escapes with a helicopter and possible survivors that Frank rescued. Frank returns to the helipad alone, and DeLuca's helicopter arrives, but crashes into the mall's clock tower when a stowaway zombie attacks him.</div>
