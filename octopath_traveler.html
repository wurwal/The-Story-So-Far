                <h1>Octopath Traveler</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">Octopath Traveler is set in the land of Orsterra, which was created by thirteen deities. One of them, the fallen god Galdera, was sealed away within the afterworld by the other deities after he refused to relinquish what they created. The Order of the Sacred Flame, the continent's dominant church, formed to worship the leader of the non-fallen gods, which continue to preside over Orsterra.<br><br>The player follows the stories of eight heroes as they journey through Orsterra.<br><br>After progressing through all the characters' various stories, the heroes' quests become intermingled as Ophilia's enemy Mattias, Cyrus' enemy Lucia, the Obsidians, and Olberic’s enemy Werner are all revealed to have been under the employ of the immortal witch Lyblac. Revealed to be Galdera's daughter, Lyblac orchestrated the acquisition of From the Far Reaches of Hell and the dragonstones to unseal the Gate of Finis in order to access the afterworld; she also orchestrated the fall of Hornburg, as it stands atop the Gate. Using the Obsidians as her personal army to eliminate threats like Primrose's father, Lyblac also attempted to use Graham Crossford, the man who wrote Tressa's journal and saved Alfyn as a boy, as a vessel for Galdera to gain corporeal form due to his bloodline's ties to the god. Graham escaped from her clutches, but was mutated into H’aanit’s enemy Redeye. This forced Lyblac to seek out Graham's only living son Kit to complete the ritual.<br><br>At the Gate of Hornburg, Lyblac fully resurrects Galdera and is absorbed into him. The eight heroes fight a vicious battle against Galdera, sealing him back into the afterworld and saving Kit, who receives closure with his father's spirit.</div>
