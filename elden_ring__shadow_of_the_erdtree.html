                <h1>Elden Ring  Shadow Of The Erdtree</h1>
                <div class="synopsis-content animate__fadeIn animate__animated">During their quest, the Tarnished meets a mysterious maiden named Melina, who offers her assistance in return for being brought to the Erdtree. After proving themselves by driving away an Omen named Margit, Melina brings them to the Roundtable Hold – a gathering place for Tarnished – where they meet the Two Fingers, who reveals that at least two of Elden Ring's shards must be collected and brought to the Erdtree to repair it.<br><br>Eventually, the Tarnished makes their way to the foot of the Erdtree, where they once again duel Margit – revealed to really be Morgott – and kills him this time. However, even when having the necessary shards, they find the path inside blocked by thorns. In response, Melina advises the Tarnished to seek out the Fell God's power, the Flame of Ruin, and ignite the Erdtree. Alternatively, they can also form a pact with another outer god, the corruptive Frenzied Flame. Should the Tarnished use the Flame of Ruin, Melina immolates herself as the kindling to set the Erdtree alight. No sacrifice is needed if the Frenzied Flame is used, but Melina abandons the Tarnished.<br><br>As the Erdtree burns, the Tarnished tracks down and kills Maliketh to obtain the Rune of Death, infusing it into the flames to burn away the thorns. On their way back to the Erdtree, however, they are confronted by Gideon, who has gone mad after learning the truth about the Greater Will, and Godfrey, who seeks to reclaim the Elden Lord title. After vanquishing them both, the Tarnished enters the Erdtree, where they fight and slay both Radagon and the Elden Beast. Afterward, the Tarnished gains access to Marika's corpse, containing the remnants of the Elden Ring, from which six endings are available depending on their choice of allies:</div>
